# Full pseudocode (draft 3) of subworld story 1 (graf headers only)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* [Pseudocode example](#pseudoexample)


## Pseudocode
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### Opening scene: a calm black sea, broken by a sub

* [ ] _Open on a completely empty dome of black sky over a perfectly still pitch black ocean_
	* {pull from draft opening already written}


* [ ] _A submarine breaks the surface, its sail rising up slowly. A hatch opens and a woman steps out on top of the sail._
	* [ ] She lights a cigarillo, the light of the match piercing the darkness
	* [ ] The engines run hot and noisy, spewing up into the air above the calm sea.
	* {They are running on the surface to charge batteries, but don't make this explicit}


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## pseudocode example -- modified for story planning
:pseudoexample:


### Section/scene description gets three ###s; two blank lines above; one below

* [ ] _paragraph description or plotting point to hit_
	* [ ] A line that should be added to final --- whether as is, or needing to be re-written.
	* {thought or comment about above line}

* [ ] _paragraphs/plotting point separated by space, above, new graf below, description of what the graf covers in this line_
	* [ ] Something that needs to be included under above plotting point.
	* [ ] > draft attempt at actual prose {especially good if you have a good idea for prose while putting together pseudocode}

# Full pseudocode (draft 3) of subworld story 1 (graf headers only)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* [Pseudocode example](#pseudoexample)


## Pseudocode
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### Opening scene: a calm black sea, broken by a sub --- (on a dead calm sea)

* [X] _Open on a completely empty dome of black sky over a perfectly still pitch black ocean_
	* {pull from draft opening already written}


* [X] _A submarine breaks the surface, its sail rising up slowly. A hatch opens and a woman steps out on top of the sail --- Captain Sylvia Percy_
	* [X] She lights a cigarillo, the light of the match piercing the darkness
	* [X] The engines run hot and noisy, spewing up into the air above the calm sea.
	* {They are running on the surface to charge batteries, but don't make this explicit}

* [X] _Hemi joins her on the bridge. They run for a while, enjoying the strange still blackness of the night._
	* [ ] Add something about the leather clothes they are wearing?

* [X] _Percy stays on the bridge, smoking, until they get out from under the clouds. They get the batteries partially charged up_


### They are rammed by another sub

* [X] _Then the whole sub shudders, a look of panic crosses Hemi's face, and anger crosses Percy's. The whole ship lists over. They try to figure out what happened. A black monster of another sub rises up to the surface, on it's bow is mounted a medieval-looking ram,  and then descends under the waves. They figure out they had been rammed._

* [X] _Percy orders the Prospect down fast. They seal up and crash dive._

* [X] _They receive a call over ship-to-ship and are informed that they are violating the territory of some complicated sounding authority._
	* {Or something to this effect? Keep the enemy sub mysterious, but also start to hint at the ridiculous power structure of the surface -- the story reveals the surface structure when the Prospect is on the LITERAL surface}


### Staring at dials as they sink

* [X] _They go down, staring at dials (maybe steal some from earlier staring-at-dials-during-dives drafts)_

* [X] _But when they go to level off, the boat's sluggish. (take from draft of captain not able to read what her ship is doing from the dials --- it doesn't make sense)_

* [X] _Percy goes down to try to figure out what's wrong_
	* {chance to describe ship}

* _Percy finds the flooding in the main cargo bay_

* [X] _Back in the control room, Hemi deals with sonar pings and the pursuing sub_

* [X] _Percy recruits Chips to stop the flooding_
	* [X] Percy tells Chips she needs her to help stop the flooding.
	* [X] Chips panics: "the _main_ cargo bay? Our primary buoyancy reserve? There's no way to close that off with bulkheads!
	* [X] > "We're so fucked! So so fucked. The motherfucking main cargo hold is flooding!"
	* [X] > "For fuck's sake Chips, give me an actual report, not the panicked screaming of a goddamn child." 

* [X] _The crew go into the cargo hold to try and patch the leaks in the flooded water. The ship is sinking._


### They blow the tanks

* [X] _Percy orders the tanks blow. Warning sirens go off and two giant levers overhead are pulled. There's a rush of air and water... but the boat keeps sinking._
	* {maybe it's more exciting if the tanks are blown from the engine room --- then the distinction between the regular ballast tanks and the fuel ballast wrench is more exciting and coherent.} 
	* {The tank blow wrenches rest in specially padded toolboxes that are easily accessible

* [X] _But the fuel blow doesn't work either._

* [ ] {Consider: Connect what happens here to critical moments later in the story --- something wrong with the fuel tanks because of the emergency blow? the fuel gauge got fucked, and they end up with not nearly as much fuel as they thought or something?}


### They head for a seamount

* [X] _They realize they are going to sink past the crush depth. The consult charts (or the sonar listens) to discover there's a seamount nearby._
	* {It's probably more interesting stylistically to NOT reveal what they are doing, Maybe just have Percy give orders, (she and Hemi know what's happening, but not the reader?) and they take actions, but it's a surprise when they hit the bottom on top of the seamount?)}

* [X] _They are going down slowly, but irrevocably._


* [X] _Percy asks Hemi to figure out what's the slowest they can go to avoid detetction (in their very silent electric boat) vs the fastst they can go to to get to safety_

* [X] _Percy goes down to engineering and finds the specially-fitted wrench and blows the fuel ballast tanks. This slows their downward progress, but they HAVE to make it to the Guyot on the batteries now._
	* {the fuel ballast blow wrenches are in separate padded toolboxes (with worn velveteen maybe) that are padlocked. Percy has the key} 


### They bottom on the peak of a seamount --- (sunk on the top of a seamount (like Moses on Ararat))

* [X] _They drive the boat hard to get over the seamount, and bottom it on the peak. Like Moses on Ararat._
	* {NOW use your staring-dials-fear... they don't know where the bottom is, or if they will be crushed before they hit it.}
	* {Be careful that this doesn't seem too much like Das Boot. Avoid this by shaping it as a slow-motion sinking and deliberately seeking out the seamount, rather than the way the boat goes down out of control in Das Boot to be saved by a 'shovelful of sand'}

* [X] _Bottoming it means the enemy sub can't find them with sonar. They repair their sub, pump out the water, and lift off the guyot/tablemount._
	* {'Tablemount' is probably better because you don't have to explain what it means.}
	* [X] The repair is a foul mix of steel plates and bracing and globulous welds.
		* {Chips spends the rest of the story repairing freshly sprung leaks from the patches --- make note of this in a couple of places}

* [X] Chips is furious at a maneuver that Percy made, gets in a fight with her. Percy fires her, confines her to her rack.


### Back on the surface

* [X] _On the surface, they realize they are stranded, with batteries drained and no fuel._
	* [X] The weather is gray, and thiere's a mist
	* [X] They ask who controls this part of the surface. "Uh, the Western Federated Socialists I think." Says Hemi. "At least last time I looked at a Territorial Authorities map --- but that was more than a year ago."
	* [X] Those assholes are bad news. We should get out of here.

* [X] _They get on a smugglers channel on the radio, and raise a narco sub that's not too far off. Its Shakes._

* [X] _Shakes motors up and introduces himself_
	* [X] His hand is shaking
	* [X] "We smugglers need to stick together eh?" Percy looked dead at him while she said "We're not smugglers, we're Independent Logistics Operators."
	* [X] He tells them he's headed for a remote depot on an isolated ocean island a hundred nautical miles or so away

* [X] _Hemi inspects Shake's boat_
	* [X] The Gnat has a window built into the sail
	* [X] He runs a comb through engine grese and runs it through his spikey blonde hair
	* [X] Hemi is not impressed with the state of Shakes' boat. There's a conversation about how Shakes always got away with running _just_ under the surface, all that diving seemed excessively dangerous to him. Make it clear his boat can only dive 30 meters or so.

* [X] _At Hemi's urging, Percy resolves things with Chips_
	* Never admitting she was wrong
	* Leave the tension hanging there

* [o] _they eat a meal_ 
	* [X] Shakes brought nothing but cold canned foods with him. The Prospect has submarine food: spoiling kimchi, stale rice, dried fish 
	* [ ] dessicated citrus.
	* [X] "If you can heat it, you can eat it."	

* [X] They make a plan
	* [X] Mate the Gnat to the Prospect's underside, run electrical and fuel up into the Prospect, and power the Prospect that way
	* [X] Requires creating a mating collar for the Gnat

* [X] _They go for the island depot.  It will take hours._
	* [X] One goal is to get over the authority border line; mostly just to hint at how the authorities carved up control on the surface_
	* [X] It's night on the surface, but bright with a big moon, fairly reasonable sized waves that hide the sail of the _Prospect_ a little.
	* [X] They pick up a faint radar contact, and decide they need to risk submerging to periscope depth and running on what little batteries they have
	* [X] Through the periscope Percy sees the same black sub with the ram on the surface, and then it dives.
	* [X] They think it might be chasing them, (though their hope is it lost them when they went to periscope) but as they cross the Authority line it disappears, apparently missing them.
	* [X] At some point Hemi, Percy, (and Shakes?) need to have a conversation about why the black sub rammed them.
		* Ideally, there is some secret/personal reason the sub is after them. Perhaps hinted at but not revealed right here.
	* [X] They come up with batteries completely drained and run on diesel the rest of the way to the depot

* [X] _They use remaining battery to dock (from the underside) with an underwater dock_
	* Through the scope they see an empty island, and report that to Shakes. He informs them it's an underwater dock.
	* (Or maybe they need to have someone run them out some fuel to do this or something. That... might be really boring, so maybe they just have enough power left to hit the underwater dock)


### --- (a depot (for repairs and pick up cargo))

* [ ] _While at the depot, they arrange for repairs to be made, and to get the boat refueled_
	* [X] Explain that while this depot is constantly harassed by Authorities, it's also a critical supply line for them, so allowed to continued to exist.
	* {Maybe? Or maybe you have to edit the text so far so the Authorities here aren't SO brutal --- oh wait it's over the Authority line, remember? That's why the Authorities here aren't so aggressive.}

* [o] _They get an offer for a clandestine cargo --- magnetic mines_
	* [O] Percy is approached in the parts shop by a old crone:
		* [X] the only small person Percy has seen so far in the depot: she has large rubbery ears and a small wrinkled nose that wiggles when she talks in her soft raspy voice.
		* [X] {she is, in fact, a fairy godmother/witch with a cursed gift to offer Percy}
		* [X] She invites Percy back to her shop; offering her a job
		* [X] She heard about Percy from a note passed up the depot from the dock boss, though Percy intuits this, the crone doesn't say it aloud
			* [X] {unsaid: because Percy is a woman, and the dock boss identifies with her --- thus make sure Percy introduces herself as captain to the dock boss when they meet the first time} 
		* [X] it's a lucrative but dangerous job offer: moving magnetically triggered explosives that could potentially be weapons parts. Can't get even some of the permits usually gotten.
		* [X] She suggests Percy takes the cash and settle down with a nice man. Percy says she is married to her boat;
	* {skip the bits establishing the authority methods -- that should have happened earlier}

* [ ] _Percy asks depot bar tender about hiring a sonar operator. He offers his unmarketable whore Cassandra._

* [ ] _Conversation with Cassandra about hiring her as a sonar operator_

* [ ] Percy has to have a conversation with Chips --- maybe at the urging of Hemi --- where she gets re-hired for the next run.

* [ ] _Chips overseas the work on some poorly done and over-priced repairs, saying she was doing a better job when she was under water._
	* Don't forget that while they were at the surface, the leak probably only seeped a bit, but with some pressure on at the underwater dock, it's more steadily pouring in.


* [ ] _Percy buys Shakes dinner at the one crappy diner in the depot to pay him back, and hires him to run interference for them with the mines cargo_
	* [ ] Percy is so flush with this run that she can offer Shakes a job, and make up what she feels she owes him. She offers him two deck-boss shares, or something.
	* [ ] He is excited to not be sneaking around, looks forward to trying to make as MUCH noise as possible, rather than being silent all the time. It's more in his line of speciality
	* [ ] Shakes makes sure to get his manuals back from the _Prospect_


* [ ] _At the Prospect, it's being repaired, refueled, and loaded with the magnetic mine cargo_
	* Some further description of the layout of the Prospect might go here

* [ ] _They seal up the boat and embark_
	* Leave Shakes there with plan to rendezvous soon

### rendezvous with the Gnat; Interstitial traveling from depot; 

* [ ] _Training Cassandra scene_

* [ ] _They run underwater for 24 hours, but at the next nightfall, they decide to surface to recharge the batteries_

* [ ] _They rendezvous with the Gnat, who left the depot after them; Shakes tells them that the authority sub wrecked the depot, and knows they are carrying war contraband._
	* Remember: the Gnat has to mate with the _Prospect_ from underneath.
	* Shakes fills them in on what happened since they left the depot:
		* They arrived a couple of days after the _Prospect_ left 
			* {maybe, think about the timing, since Shakes will have to make up the distance to make the rendezvous}
		* the sub with the ram docked, went through the whole depot checking papers
		* They specifically were asking about the Prospect; they found out the Prospect left hauling weapons parts, but they were after the Prospect BEFORE that
		* the dock boss closed the watertight bulkhead to the dock while a bunch of the ram sub's crew were up on the exchange level. They were stuck there until the bulkhead could be reopened.
		* Shakes got off in the Gnat in the confusion
	* [ ] Maybe here is where you come back to the cause for the black sub to be chasing them:
		* Maybe it's that they are after Owen ("the kid?") for some reason? Something he did, he ran away from Authority military? Took something with him? Slept with the commander's wife? (I kinda dig that, this story needs more sex)
		* Though keep in mind note about randomness of human cruelty --- maybe Owen says the commander doesn't even LIKE his wife, he just wants to kill Owen for the sheer belligerence of it.
	* [ ] {don't neglect to revise from first draft: the sub is chasing them for some OTHER reason, the magnetic mines just get piled on}

* [ ] Shakes tells them about the modifications he made to the Gnat to make it much louder.
	* [ ] Shakes makes modifications to the Gnat for the job, to run louder on diesel
		* that is unique for a submarine
	* [ ] he tells them he also got a pigeon for communicating with the Gnat
		* (See pigeon conversation notes in todos)
	* [ ] Had a deck gun mounted 

### --- (on the surface in a storm; wave porn)

* [ ] _They need to recharge batteries, so they come up on the surface, at night. The plan is for the Gnat to run intercept._

* [ ] _They come up in a moderate storm; the whine, push and crash of the boat and engines sounds like Dopesmoker_

* [ ] _hours go by, boredom sets in; the Gnat and the Prospect stay in touch via CB-style ship-to-ship radio_

* [ ] _they are all half-asleep on the midnight watch: bleary-eyed, staring at the dials, bored out of their minds, numb from the sensory deprivation sound, hum, and vibration of the ceaseless and unvarying engine rumbling through the boat_
	* {nobody is on sonar because it's not military ship, and because you can't hear anything above the sound of the engine anyway}	


### --- (the sub sneaks up on them because they can't hear them over the crashers)

* [ ] _Cassandra (possibly because she is just getting the hang of things) doesn't hear the sub until it is right on them. It fires its deck-gun at them._
	* {Don't forget to capture the idea of Cassandra putting her mind out into the water --- some of the sonar-only idea you've had for telling sub stories}
	* {maybe it's not going to try ramming them again because of the storm? they know it's the same sub because of the unique ram on the bow}

* [ ] _Gregory is killed in the attack. They leave his body awash on the deck as the descend, blood running down the deck and mixing with the whitewater pouring over it._
	* Percy dives out from under him with him pounding on the Hatch.
	* (Or should this be Chips? Would that be more dramatically interesting?)
	* He gets up and waves to the sub with the ram as the Prospect is diving, but they shoot him.
	* His body drapes over the fairing, and then floats up off the sail as it disappears under him.

* [ ] _The enemy sub uses both loudspeakers and ship-to-ship to warn them not to submerge by the authority of blah blah_

* [ ] _They realize the enemy sub is turning away, getting some distance so they can fire torps. they fire_

* [ ] _Panicked fear as they push the boat down, caught between the pincers of the torpedo incoming and the cold depths of hell below them._

* [ ] _The torpedo implodes at 200 meters, it can't swim deeper than that._


### Chase scene

* [ ] _This is where the long O'Brian style chase scene goes, perhaps the batteries run down, then they cruise on the surface, or something_
	* [ ] A scene where they are eating in the galley
	* [ ] something breaks that needs fixing --- possible the original wound from the ramming breaks open again
	* [ ] They listen in silence, pushing down their own fear. But that can't prevent small tears from welling up in Percy's eyes.
	* [ ] Watching the battery gauges --- how long can they go before they are forced to the surface?

* [ ] This is where they should implement the Gnat being noisy technique to try to distract their pusuers

### --- (hiding in the depths, escape under the deep scattering layer)

* [ ] _The dive below the deep scattering layer_
	* {consider note from rough narrative section with the suggestion that it might be dramatic if they keep getting detected and keep having to go deeper, until they are at the limits of their depths and batteries.}
		* Now they pop a rivet or something, they are TOO deep, scarily deep.
	* Cassandra thinks they will crash into the bottom, Percy knows they will go right through it because it's just fish.
	* {Where's the Gnat? I think it goes and gets lost in the storm}

* [ ] _And motor quietly away._

* [ ] _They make the run into port on the surface._
	* {Is this where they come up in a blessed fog?}

* [ ] They contact Shakes via Pigeon:
	* "ok, get the pigeon" "guiaullme" "guiaullme, and tell Shakes...."


### --- (Into an exotic remote city with junks everywhere; homes built on stilts;  unload cargo at port)

* [ ] _They arrive at an exotic remove city, with wooden homes built on stilts and junks with fishermen._
	* Hints at the economy of the city, the whole thing built on stilts
		* it's not _ancient_; it's relatively new development, but impoverished
		* including warehouses and depots
		* it was easier than draining the swampland that made up most of the territorial area
	* the giant metal machine tooling through rickety wood structures;

* [ ] _The find their dock and unload._

* [ ] _The enemy sub shows up, a giant black leviathan smashing its way through the flimsy wooden structures._


### Leave in a hurry; cruise down the continental shelf

* [ ] _They scram out of the port, and cruise down the continental shelf just above the bottom so they can't be found._


### --- (bicycle race in the hangar)

* [ ] _A bicycle race (like 7 Cycles Christmas party) in the empty cargo bay._

* [ ] _A submarine is just a very very complicated bicycle_


### --- (into the pacific garbage patch; the final battle)

* [ ] _They head out into the deep ocean, in a sea full of garbage_
	* (Not plastic. there's little/no plastic in this world)

* [ ] _The enemy sub is pursuing_

* [ ] _They come up with a plan. They mate with the Gnat._
	* Maybe this is where Percy says 'get Shakes on the pigeon'
	* "Goddamn it! Get Shakes on the...pigeon." "His name is Guillaume" said Hemi. "I don't care what his name is! Just get Shakes to reverse course!"

* [ ] _as they are loading parts onto the Gnat (no time to explain the plan to Shakes) the enemy comes into range. maybe fires again?_
	* [ ] Hemi desperately searches the Prospect for clamps --- like the ones Percy didn't buy at the store in the depot

* [ ] _Hemi jumps into the Gnat and orders it off the mating collar (the Prospect is a little unwieldy with the Gnat on her deck)_


### in the _Gnat_

[//]: # (Somewhere in here: have Hemi comment on the airplane-style controls? Maybe move that to later when Hemi is riding with Shakes and the magnetic mines.)

* [ ] _Hemi starts assembling his devices, (with slide-rule calculations of how much pressure each air bag needs to hold it steady in the water column) he explains the plan to Shakes as he does._

* [ ] The Gnat surfaces and runs loud to try and confuse the black sub.
	* Hemi hits a strut with a spanner when he wants Shakes to dive.

* [ ] _the risky part is that the enemy is too smart to go after the _Gnat_ -- they know the _Gnat_ is there just to run interference, that's why they give off chasing the _Gnat_ earlier and turned after the _Prospect_ -- so they have to use the _Prospect_ itself as the bait this time._

* [ ] _Percy will run the _Prospect_ at 100 meters, full-engine like they are trying to get away._

* [ ] _the enemy sub will run at the same depth, trying to line up an underwater torpedo shot._

* [ ] _The Gnat has to run _between_ them, and release their homemade magnetic mines. And hope Hemi got the calculations right._


### Ending

* {They are all fishing on the deck?}
	* {Perhaps this is the one time in the novel where the weather on the surface is good? The one time nature isn't trying to kill them? Is that too much of a cliche? Maybe the only good weather is when they come up from bottoming?} 

* {Or, possibly we just follow Cassandra (make her the main character) to her next thing}

* {or something else?}



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## pseudocode example -- modified for story planning
:pseudoexample:


### Section/scene description gets three ###s; two blank lines above; one below

* [ ] _paragraph description or plotting point to hit_
	* [ ] A line that should be added to final --- whether as is, or needing to be re-written.
	* {thought or comment about above line}

* [ ] _paragraphs/plotting point separated by space, above, new graf below, description of what the graf covers in this line_
	* [ ] Something that needs to be included under above plotting point.
	* [ ] > draft attempt at actual prose {especially good if you have a good idea for prose while putting together pseudocode}

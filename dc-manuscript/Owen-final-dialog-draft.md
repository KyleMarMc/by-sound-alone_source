Captain Percy was sure that the explosion of the second device had literally rocked her boat. Just a sway, but enough force to make Percy start worrying about the strength of the seam in the cargo hold once again.

"Cassandra! The second detonation: I need to know the results. Now."

"Yes Captain Percy... I'm hearing a lot of popping and crackling. Hold on..." She scanned the sonar. The soundscape was a mess: massive churning bubbles of air rising towards the surface, creaking and cracking metal, rushing water ...and distant screams of terror.

What had been one contact was now splitting into two distinct parts. Those parts resolved themselves over a matter of a few seconds, and then Cassandra could hear the two pieces falling away from her. "Captain Percy, the _Grackle_ is in two pieces, and sinking."

Percy grinned. "I can't believe Hemi and Shakes pulled that off! One chance in five indeed." She lit a cheroot. "Cassandra! Find the _Gnat_! As fast as possible!"

Before Cassandra could reply the dial on the ship-to-ship unit lit up above Captain Percy's Head. "Sylvia..."

Percy's eyes snapped up to the ship-to-ship. That was not Hemi or Shakes' voice.

"Sylvia... are you going to leave me to die a second time?" The voice came riding on a background of wailing klaxons, creaking metal, and shouting men.

Sylvia slowly reached a hand up to take the mic. She thumbed the transmitter. "...Owen? ...But how?"

"You left me wounded on the sail of the _Prospect_ as you dove. You knew I was still alive. You heard me banging. And I would have died in minutes in that storm, except by sheer luck I washed aboard the deck of the _Grackle_. Unlike you, they opened the hatch when they heard me banging. But I guess my fate is to be destroyed by your selfish disregard --- one way or another."

"Owen... I didn't..." Her thumb fell off the transmitter. The radio was dead for a few seconds.

"When the _Grackle_ opened the hatch, I thought I was being given a chance. A chance to clear the world of your callous disregard for other people. I told them all about you: that your hold was full of weapons, even after Stilt City; that you were supplying rebels up and down the coast on this side of the ocean; that you were a crazy idealist who would stop at nothing to support the overthrow of Authority power; that you had a shipment of valuable metals aboard and would make a fat prize. I told them anything they needed to hear to keep them after you."

Percy could hear Owen breathing heavily into the mic.

"The worst thing isn't being left to die by you a second time. It's that there turned out to be no purpose to it all. Redeemed from drowning, the purpose to my life was clear. My story was to be left for dead, and the rise again to take you down Sylvia. But now... Now I see there is no purpose, no narrative to my life. The world is nothing. Nothing but people like you, and long odds against any achievement. And everything balanced precariously over a bottomless hole."

The radio went dark, and did not light again.

[//]: # (Surprise! It was Owen all along. Or at least since the storm. In the early versions of the book, I made the motivation much more abstract -- that the commander of the Grackle was after them because Own screwed his wife; but at the same time he did not really _feel_ that, he just felt like it was his duty to be a jealous husband and so took up this chase simply because that is what society expected him to do, not because he particularly cared. I still find that idea compelling and interesting myself: How much do our actions REALLY come from our emotions, and how much are they societally determined? But test readers were universally confused by this idea, so I give the reader what they want: a straight revenge story with a twist ending. It fits better with the style of the book anyway and ties everything up in a neat narrative knot that may be unlike real life, but is very like what people want from a good story. I thought once maybe I could make this novel accessible and fun to read AND an art novel that probes deeper more abstract questions about human nature. I guess accessible and fun to read conquered abstraction and complexity -- at least I hope so!)

Did you enjoy this book? I encourage you to sign up for the mailing
list. It's one of the single most important things you can do to support
creative work you admire. There will be no spam. There will be very
little email at all. Mostly it's a way for me to make sure the people
who are most interested in my work know about new stuff when it becomes
available.

You can request to be added to the mailing list here:

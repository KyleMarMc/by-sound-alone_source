# Three things to do if you enjoyed this book

1. For chrissake, pass the book on!
	* Julian Barnes points out that for every book there is someone, somewhere, someday who will be the last reader of that book.
	* _Please_ don't be my last reader.
	* I'm not asking anything else of you. I don't need your money, or love, or nomination to a McArthur grant. All I need is for you to pass on your copy of this book to someone else. Hopefully with at least as much an endorsement as "it's worth a read."

2. I encourage you to sign up for the mailing
list. It's one of the single most important things you can do to support
creative work you admire. There will be no spam. There will be very
little email at all. Mostly it's a way for me to make sure the people
who are most interested in my work know about new stuff when it becomes
available.

You can request to be added to the mailing list here:

3.  _If you really, really liked this book, and you feel like you really,
    really want to give someone money for it, maybe consider donating to one of
the many open source software foundations. Try to pick one that is scrappy and
small, since well-known open-source software often is (and should be) supported
by the for-profit companies making bazillions of dollars off their work. Or, if
you are among those who despise all things software and technology, how about
housing instead? Housing Court Answers does amazing work with low-income
tenants in NYC: https://housingcourtanswers.org/_

# README subworld-story_1
* [index](index.md) for file listings
* This repo is for building out the first subworld story.
* "subworld" --- an alternate-timeline post-war world where the surface of the Earth is so tied up with aggression and bureaucracy that the only way for global commerce to operate smoothly is through the utilization of huge merchant submarines.
	* And where there is commerce, there is smuggling... 
* It should be private until there is something of substance, and then converted the public along the model for collected stories.
* Think about which license to apply.

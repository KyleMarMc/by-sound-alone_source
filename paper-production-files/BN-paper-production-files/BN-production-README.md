Note: If your page count changes by any significant margin, you need
to download the template from B&N and re-adjust the cover layout
(particularly the spine) to fit the new book dimensions. (A different
page count yields a fatter or skinnier book, so the horizontal dimension
changes.)

Also: BN apparently adds two pages for a barcode _inside_ the book. So submit div/4+2 pages to them for the interior file

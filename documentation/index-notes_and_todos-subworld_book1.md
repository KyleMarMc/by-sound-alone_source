* more detailed description possibilities: 
	* Set in an alternate-timeline post-WWII Earth, where a combination of cold and hot wars have ground the entire surface of the planet down to a military-bureaucratic morass making free movement nearly impossible, commerce has found a way in the form of a network of semi-clandestine transport submarines that take advantage of the freedom of movement offered by the vast three-dimensional space offered by moving cargo underwater.

## style 
:style: 
* manliness:
	* One thing I'm trying to do in this book is salvage the lone-male fantasy
		* First by making it not exclusively "male"
		* Second by doing it without guns (1970s trucker movies are a perfect fit for that)
	* See this article: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/04/opinion/guns-america-western-mythology.html 
		* For a good outline of what's wrong with the male fantasy, including Cormac McCarthy 
	* One of my test readers criticized the book for being too "male"; 
		* But I believe the individualist male fantasy is validly compelling; it just needs to be adapted to not be racist, sexist, capitalist, and nationalist.
		* Keep the violence though.
	* Also life on the barren frontier (mentioned in article above):
		* Deadliest Catch does this too: the individual out in the frontier landscape, their wits against mother nature
			* (ignoring the gun nuts on the show) 
		* This is *important* work because Deadliest Catch is redeeming the male myth, without recourse to killing brown people with weapons.
		* Redeeming the lone male myth is the BEST way to address the problems with it.
* 'feminine' qualities vs 'masculine' qualities --- women who live on a dirty machine
* [X] try putting in more cursing. Maybe it seems like it's hard to do it genuinely. but on the other hand, maybe all you have to do is _do_ it --- curses every third word.
	* I think TV has programmed you to think you can't use cursing so much. But even TV that doesn't shy away from cursing still has far less cursing than even average real life. (except Deadwood of course)
	* And a lot more cursing might actually be a simple way to make it grittier.
	* Also they're a bunch of fuckin sailors!
	* Maybe the only time they don't curse is when someone is _truly_ angry? (Or is it better to go like Steve on Deadwood at his angriest?)
		* **Like the note you read about 'fuck' during WWII: the only time it wasn't used was when something serious was happing: "Grab your [no-fucking] guns."**
		* I think this is a good revision to make. do it!
	* [X] Maybe Hemi is the one character who doesn't (normally/ever) curse?
		* Chips: curses all the time
		* Shakes: a lot
		* Percy: When she's pissed
		* Hemi: never
* fitzcorraldo: hauling explosive parts over a mountain
* remember to include a lot of spatial description: the reader should be able to SEE the sub/spaces in their head.  
	* build a map in their head for them.  
* there is an underlying idea that the machines of this world are rational and knowable. There is order to them, and the accessibility for most people to be able to understand how they work because they are logical. The world of machines makes sense. It is not wicked.
	* The layer above that is the world of the human mind: infinitely complex and unknowable. No person's motivation can be relied upon to be rational or logical (this is the untruth at the heart of so many novels and the discipline of acting --- writers/storytellers use simplified/simplistic human motivation as a shorthand to drive stories. It's not very real at all. ...On the other hand I think it makes it easier to create compelling characters (Shakes?) and drive them through a plot.) 
* Just make the first submarine novel GO: 
	* Go for character-driven (fear) excitement through staring at dials 
	* This first book should be the pop novel: readable, accessible, character-driven 
	* Go for descriptive renderings of sounds, and on the rare occasions it merits it, sights 
	* accessibility is more important than style: 
		* do NOT fall into the trap of keeping things abstract for the sake of style. those books are often (and often rightfully) unpopular.
		* on the other hand layering style on top of accessibility is the dream: like Batman
* maybe with the engine running full blast, it SOUNDS heavy and grimy, like Dopesmoker.
	* try to think about what a listener to dopesmoker would want to read. 
* think carefully about where you "dive" into description:
	* character's clothing, for example, should just be mentioned in casual passing: "she placed the pencil into the front pocket of her cracking leather overalls."
	* but you might want to go all-in with description when they are staring at dials under pressure.
* remember to focus on _description_ of the grime, darkness, cold, hardness. Make it feel like Deadwood or Blood Meridian, though with good story. Do NOT make it feel like a sci-fi or naval/military story.
* consider NOT having any exterior shots. 
	* it may help the sense of isolation and being in a can if all action takes place _inside_ (the depot, the _Prospect_, the _Gnat_) 
	* having considered this, where I do have exterior shots so far I really like them. I'm not getting rid of them.
	* Though perhaps they end up being the exception that proves the rule.
* Even though it would have been cool to have people communicating on the boat through tubes, that's really a 19th century thing, and I think for where these boats are at, historically, it would just have to be intercoms.

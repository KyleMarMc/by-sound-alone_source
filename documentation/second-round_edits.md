# Second round edits
Edits to pick up in second full pass through the book


* [ ] Need to include a description of Percy somewhere early in the book
	* (There's the line about the leather pants she's wearing when she's kneeling on the grates; this might need to be moved up into or reflected in description of her)
	* [ ] Subtly reinforce Percy's beauty in more places:
		* Right now I think she reads more like the elder captain she will be in later stories
		* Other characters should sometimes react to her youth and beauty --- but she has no interest in that herself.
		* The older version of her (see character notes) was really for being a role model for Shakes. That isn't in this first book. Maybe later.* [ ] make sure you only explain active sonar once
	* [ ] Make sure it's clear that the ping is the sound of 'active' sonar. Describe the sound of the ping
* [ ] Percy should have a captain's chair in the control room. Or at least a station she stands at.
	* (I think her standing station gets established later in the story, make sure it makes sense in the earlier parts of the book)
	* maybe refer to it explicitly as the 'captain's station'? (akin to the sonar station and the navigation station)
* [ ] make sure you make it clear early on that Hemi is the 'Deck Boss'
* [ ] mention that the navigation table is lit from underneath? (Is it? or is it just a well-lit station?)
* [ ] Is the PA one ship-wide system? Or does it go to different specific compartments? Or both?
	* decide, edit and then make sure it's reflected in the Prospect notes file
* [ ] Change Trinity's name
	* Trinity, turns out, is the name of the love-interest in the Matrix
	* So change it, unless on re-watching the matrix somehow it makes sense that this little old lady is also named Trinity.
* [ ] add something about Cassandra: listening to music; 
* [ ] while the name _Gnat_ works, I keep having my doubts about _Prospect_.
	* P felt right when I first started using it, but feels less right as I go along
	* This might be a thing to ask test-reader's feedback on
* [ ] The name Chips doesn't feel like it's working
* [ ] Do a search on 'very' and consider removing any
* [ ] Do a search on 'really' and consider removing any
* [ ] make sure you don't 'shut down' the electric motors, just that they are either running with the diesels powering them, or with the batteries powering them.
	* Maybe the electric motors are only 'powered down'
* [ ] When Hemi convinces Chips to work again (around line 1084) he says Percy never apologizes --- make sure this is true throughout the book
* [ ] do a search for '-ly' and remove any useless adverbs. Maybe 'that' too.
* [ ] Add a scene where the outside landscape is detected on sonar:
	* huge sunken wrecked vehicles
	* maybe getting towards the gargbage gyre -- ships that have sunk
	* like the dream I had
* [ ] does the prospect have a record player? maybe they get one later. Maybe cassandra complains about the lack of one at some point, and that becomes your music reference for her.
* [ ] Add? "The way sound travels underwater is complex, sometimes almost magical."
	* Though there is already a line about how sound finds new and mysterious ways to propagate in the depths
* [ ] Add a conversation about the morality of running weapons parts when they have the magnetic mines aboard
	* Maybe with shakes over ship-to-ship, just to keep it interesting
	* Maybe Shakes wonders if it's moral to run weapons
	* But Percy points out that they might be supplying a rebel group fighting for their freedoms
	* Though that rebel group might be the oppressors in 6 months
	* There's no way to keep track of who is in power, or even if there actually CAN be someone in power
	* So instead just do the job at hand, and hope it all comes out as a moral wash in the long run
* [-] Consider having Owen and Percy get into a conflict, Owen wants to make one move with the Prospect and Percy is determined to do something else. Owen turns out to be right. Percy doesn't apologize
	* ...could also be Bastian for a little character development, but I think he remains just a skinny quiet smoking pole.
	* I like that this will play in later when they decide what to do when they find out that Owen slept with the ramming sub's captain's wife.
	* though maybe this human relations element is covered by the fight with Chips
* [ ] consider adding a conversation about tools and how a character prefers hand tools whenever they can get them.

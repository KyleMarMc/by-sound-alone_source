# Second round edits
Edits to pick up in second full pass through the book

* [ ] Consider pulling back or deleting the metaphors
* [ ] Add a lot of broken things:
	* Like, have characters on their down time working on repairing all sorts of stuff
	* And for transitional passages, give a list of things repaired
* [ ] Contrast the sound and smoke and roughness of the diesels running with the quiet and elegance of the electrics motors on batteries
	* [ ] also the relationship between the black smoke pouring off the diesels and the cigarillo/cigarette smoke
* [ ] Fix motivation for chase:
	* (every reader comments on this -- none of them are getting your idea that the one-armed captain is just going through the motions for no reason other than not knowing what else to do)
	* A possibility: The sub with the ram is after them because a global bounty has been declared on illicit cargo subs.
		* The sub with the ram is a privateer, licensed to chase cargo subs, capture and take their cargo
		* It becomes a bit of a story about the wider world: shifting towards globalized markets, away from independent operators
			* It would be nice if this also hinted at the *problems* with globalized markets; beyond the fact of putting indepent logistics workers out of business 
		* give the one-armed captain back his arm
* [ ] Maybe have the Prospect painted striped black and white disruptive camo (look it up) -- because they are the white whale, they are the prey (zebra)?
* [ ] Add a scene where they quick-fix a leak with a Power Actuated Tool?
* [ ] Make a reference to the head --- a joke about how complex it is to operate.
* [ ] Have someone wash their hands with salt water soap
* [ ] Maybe have Bastian decorating his quarters with plants?
	* [ ] Ask A what plants could actually grow on a sub
* [ ] give chapters headers (but remove numbers, those are not doing anything -- but keep the number on the md file name so the order is easy t follow):
	1. Tablemount
	2. The _Gnat_
	3. Depot
	4. Herschel
	5. A Storm
	6. Stilt City
	7. Garbage Gyre
	8. Down The Hole
	* (Consider making much shorter chapters -- maybe breaks by scene?)
* [ ] You might have to reconsider "stacks blowing flame" --- diesel subs exhausted below the surface
	* (see notes in research files)
	* Maybe. There's an argument that a cargo sub might trade off a quieter under-water exhaust system for the fact that a diesel plume would be pretty hard to detect at night --- which is when they would do most of their surface-diesel running
		* This is the kind of thing that might be different about a cargo sub --- which presumably has less chance of being forced to the surface to run during the day. 
* [X] After full draft revisions are complete: scan through with spell check on; and make sure all listed spelling errors are intentional.
* [ ] After test-reader full round of edits: do a full scan through a different spellchecker, like libreoffice
* [ ] Feedback from Kevin:
	* [ ] motivation for Shakes isn't strong enough (see note about pot above --- maybe they can convince him to help out with a giant brick of pot? Maybe Bastian grows pot in his quarters, that's how they have enough to convince Shakes?)
* [ ] Feedback from Brian:
	* [ ] The start is slow, maybe pick up the writing pace a bit to match the speed of the rest of the book
		* (MT says: I think what happened here is at first I didn't know how much space everything was going to take, so I wrote longer scenes, but later had so many ideas to cram in that there wasn't space for longer scenes)
	* [ ] Cassandra says something like "I didn't realize when I agreed to this that it would be so boring" Which was maybe offensive she didn't agree since she was sold like a slave and she was escaping prositution. 
	* [ ] Some of the material handling scenes need work. People don't use a chain with a block. There is a thing called a chain hoist. You might also want to consider gantry cranes. A sub port isn't going to be fooling around.
	* [ ] There is a point where Shakes doesn't know the horsepower of the motors on his sub. That seems strange since he built it. But maybe it is intentional. 
	* [ ] You start using bearings at some point but there are places earlier where they could be used. 
	* [ ] There are a couple places in the first 15 or so pages where it is like "then this happened."  Along the line of show, don't tell, it should be something like "then Chips said to Hemi "there a X in the Y" and Hemi (did something)"
	* [ ] There are a couple of parts where the text tells the reader to appreciate something or that something is a mystery.  You could cut those and let the reader do the work
	* [ ] I felt that the air intake and exhaust were not handled when Gant was coupled to Prospect in Ch 1 or 2.
	* [ ] The sub port would be like a cup with air upside down underwater. Damage to the sub docking areas shouldn't cause flooding since the air is there, damage that would allow the air to escape would. But a large door would still be appropriate. 
		* NB: I thought about this during the first draft: the depot would be kept at 1 atmosphere so it could maintain open doors with the surface. That avoids the problem of keeping all those people in the depot at saturation (both in terms of decompression time and complexity for them to enter and exit the depot, but also for health reasons --- people with weaker bodies (Trinity) likely couldn't constantly be compressing and decompressing. (Though, maybe an interesting idea for Trinity to live a huge chunk of her life at compression?) Also the subs are at 1 atmosphere so even if the dock is only 30 feet down that means the dock air would be at 2 atmospheres and you'd have to equalize that with the docking subs. That's not just technically challenging, but the subs would not be designed to be pressurized to 2 atmosphere's from the INSIDE.
* [ ] You need to _see_ the aesthetic of the grime in your head if you want to describe it; the same way you see the mechanical bits.
	* [ ] It isn't capturing the grittiness enough, build that up
	* The scene where Percy is looking at her hands and contemplates the grime worn into the creases of her knuckles is a good example of _seeing_ the grime. I need more of that.
* [ ] there may be TOO much up and down from the control room. Maybe consider ditching the control room in the sail and put it in the same room as navigation and sonar.
	* Maybe all you need to do is remove the 'up' like: climbed into the control room, rather than: climbed up to the control room
* [ ] Consider removing parts where Percy second-guesses herself.
	* Hard to say: on the one hand it contributes the tension by having her doubt the outcome of her decisions
	* On the othe hand, you could have Hemi do the questioning (gently) and have Percy be insistent that she's right.
		* Might make for more interesting dialog
		* and Percy is NOT always right, just most of the time.
* [ ] have the junior crew call hemi 'boss'
* [ ] refer to Bastian, Gregory, and Owen as the 'deck crew'
* [ ] make sure any compass bearing degrees references are oriented to the globe, not relative to the boat
* [ ] make consistent whether numbers are written out or not
	* I think I lean towards JUST using numerals. I don't love written-out numbers in text.
	* except zero --- that needs to be written out.
	* maybe the rule is: 
		* for numbers that are part of the 'language' of the piece (including one through ten, or maybe twenty? --- twenty is where you have to start hyphenating after all) you write them out
		* And numbers that are actual measurements of things (off gauges or whatever) are numerals
* [ ] more strongly emphasize the feeling of _prey_. I think it feels like they are prey for the sub with the ram throughout the book, might as well explicitly double down on it.
* [ ] make sure the _fear_ is in there, particularly in the build up to big inflection points
* [ ] Consider adding more description of the spaces --- particularly inside the Prospect
	* How is it decorated?
	* What does it _feel_ like?
	* How is the galley laid out?
	* What does the engine room feel like?
	* What does the sonar compartment and control room feel like? (You spend so much time in those spaces)
	* (I think the cargo hold is fairly well covered, it's the main decks that are a little weak)
* [ ] watch the pacing, it's a little off in places:
	* [ ] it should be a slow build up to a big singular event like the ballast blow
	* [ ] And it should be a draw-out grind in a staring-at-dials scene that goes hauls the tension along relentlessly
	* [ ] fill in the time-passing sections with something to pull the pacing along at a slow but steady rate, 
		* don't just montage over them, it makes it feel like things are moving too fast.
* [ ] Keep in mind that in this world, like the opening set piece, nature is deliberately cruel and evil, tormenting
	* So at some point, it should be _pulling_ them to the depths
	* akin to the cruelty and evil of power --- the Authorities; but where the Authority cruelty is random, nature's cruelty is deliberate
	* The only way they survive in nature's cruelty is through their grimey, rational machine, the submarine. the submarine which always makes sense, if you can just figure it out
* [ ] Need to include a description of Percy somewhere early in the book
	* (There's the line about the leather pants she's wearing when she's kneeling on the grates; this might need to be moved up into or reflected in description of her)
	* [ ] Subtly reinforce Percy's beauty in more places:
		* Right now I think she reads more like the elder captain she will be in later stories
		* Other characters should sometimes react to her youth and beauty --- but she has no interest in that herself.
		* The older version of her (see character notes) was really for being a role model for Shakes. That isn't in this first book. Maybe later.* [ ] make sure you only explain active sonar once
	* [ ] Make sure it's clear that the ping is the sound of 'active' sonar. Describe the sound of the ping
* [ ] Percy should have a captain's chair in the control room. Or at least a station she stands at.
	* (I think her standing station gets established later in the story, make sure it makes sense in the earlier parts of the book)
	* maybe refer to it explicitly as the 'captain's station'? (akin to the sonar station and the navigation station)
* [ ] make sure you make it clear early on that Hemi is the 'Deck Boss'
* [ ] mention that the navigation table is lit from underneath? (Is it? or is it just a well-lit station?)
* [ ] Is the PA one ship-wide system? Or does it go to different specific compartments? Or both?
	* decide, edit and then make sure it's reflected in the Prospect notes file
* [ ] Change Trinity's name
	* Trinity, turns out, is the name of the love-interest in the Matrix
	* So change it, unless on re-watching the matrix somehow it makes sense that this little old lady is also named Trinity.
* [ ] add something about Cassandra: listening to music; 
* [ ] while the name _Gnat_ works, I keep having my doubts about _Prospect_.
	* P felt right when I first started using it, but feels less right as I go along
	* This might be a thing to ask test-reader's feedback on
* [ ] The name Chips doesn't feel like it's working
* [ ] Do a search on 'very' and consider removing any
* [ ] Do a search on 'really' and consider removing any
* [ ] make sure you don't 'shut down' the electric motors, just that they are either running with the diesels powering them, or with the batteries powering them.
	* Maybe the electric motors are only 'powered down'
* [ ] When Hemi convinces Chips to work again (around line 1084) he says Percy never apologizes --- make sure this is true throughout the book
* [ ] do a search for '-ly' and remove any useless adverbs. Maybe 'that' too.
* [ ] Add a scene where the outside landscape is detected on sonar:
	* huge sunken wrecked vehicles
	* maybe getting towards the gargbage gyre -- ships that have sunk
	* like the dream I had
* [ ] does the prospect have a record player? maybe they get one later. Maybe cassandra complains about the lack of one at some point, and that becomes your music reference for her.
* [ ] Add? "The way sound travels underwater is complex, sometimes almost magical."
	* Though there is already a line about how sound finds new and mysterious ways to propagate in the depths
* [ ] Add a conversation about the morality of running weapons parts when they have the magnetic mines aboard
	* Maybe with shakes over ship-to-ship, just to keep it interesting
	* Maybe Shakes wonders if it's moral to run weapons
	* But Percy points out that they might be supplying a rebel group fighting for their freedoms
	* Though that rebel group might be the oppressors in 6 months
	* There's no way to keep track of who is in power, or even if there actually CAN be someone in power
	* So instead just do the job at hand, and hope it all comes out as a moral wash in the long run
* [-] Consider having Owen and Percy get into a conflict, Owen wants to make one move with the Prospect and Percy is determined to do something else. Owen turns out to be right. Percy doesn't apologize
	* ...could also be Bastian for a little character development, but I think he remains just a skinny quiet smoking pole.
	* I like that this will play in later when they decide what to do when they find out that Owen slept with the ramming sub's captain's wife.
	* though maybe this human relations element is covered by the fight with Chips
* [ ] consider adding a conversation about tools and how a character prefers hand tools whenever they can get them.
* [ ] Hemi has stacks of books crammed into his rack (which is larger than most both because he's deck boss, and he's huge. (maybe he became deck boss _primarily_ for the larger rack. He's not one who _wants_ leadership).
	* [ ] A scene where he is reading The Recognitions (describe cover, not name title.) 
* [ ] long slow chase scene akin to O'Brian books. they run until the batteries run out and they have to surface. on the surface they are saved from being seen by a fog bank (so they are just as, if not more, blind above water as below) 
	* It would be nice to make this the _first_ story because it has all the elements of The Enemy Below. It's archetypal for a submarine story, and at the same time can introduce all styles and characters you want to use.  
* [ ] fuel oil -- is what fuel is called
* [ ] fuel ballast -- normal fuel oil tanks are filled with water as they are emptied (since they are outside the pressure hull)
	* fuel ballast tanks (not sure if these are extras, see USS Cod website) can be filled with air to get additional freeboard and run faster on the surface
	* don't forget that in non-teardrop subs, the lower they are the slower they go on the surface.

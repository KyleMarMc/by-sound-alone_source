## story descriptions: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:descriptions:
* short lines:
	* "For them, the only way to know the difference between living and dying is the small movement of a needle on a gauge."
	* "Commerce always finds a way."
* more detailed description possibilities: 
	* Set in an alternate-timeline post-WWII Earth, where a combination of cold and hot wars have ground the entire surface of the planet down to a military-bureaucratic morass making free movement nearly impossible, commerce has found a way in the form of a network of semi-clandestine transport submarines that take advantage of the freedom of movement offered by the vast three-dimensional space offered by moving cargo underwater.

## Post production Editing
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


### Find-and-fix Editing (do these before full edit pass):
-------------------------------------------------
:fnf:
* [X] Do a pass through and search for # ( in the final published version -- comments: they have a habit of showing up with even just a 'ticks' and have low tolerance for any formatting or anything.
* [ ] Change Trinity's name
	* Trinity, turns out, is the name of the love-interest in the Matrix
	* So change it, unless on re-watching the matrix somehow it makes sense that this little old lady is also named Trinity.
* [ ] while the name _Gnat_ works, I keep having my doubts about _Prospect_.
	* P felt right when I first started using it, but feels less right as I go along
	* This might be a thing to ask test-reader's feedback on
* [ ] The name Chips doesn't feel like it's working
* [ ] Do a search on 'very' and consider removing any
* [ ] Do a search on 'really' and consider removing any
* [X] Search for buoyancy and make sure it is spelled correctly
* [ ] make sure you don't 'shut down' the electric motors, just that they are either running with the diesels powering them, or with the batteries powering them.
	* Maybe the electric motors are only 'powered down'
* [ ] When Hemi convinces Chips to work again (around line 1084) he says Percy never apologizes --- make sure this is true throughout the book
* [ ] do a search for '-ly' and remove any useless adverbs. Maybe 'that' too.
* [X] write out full draft for preface; revise; insert into book file
* [X] make sure you are consistent about 'explosive mines' 'explosive warheads' 'magnetic explosives' etc
* [X] remove any references to jesus or christ or heaven --- there is no heaven, only hell. A submariner either ends up in hell, or escapes it.
	* [X] no god-damning either: there is no god
* [X] cargo bay or cargo hold? 
	* I think it's a hold on a ship
	* The underwater docking bay on the island would be the cargo bay though
* [X] Have Percy address Hemi by his full name somewhere
	* (I think she does when she introduces him to Cassandra --- check)
* [X] 'crew quarters' not 'crew's quarters' (just because I like it better, not because I looked it up_
* [X] electric motors should be plural on the prospect --- it's a dual prop
	* (Cept, annoyingly for fnf editing, there's a section where they run on a single motor to conserve power --- this is when they are running on the surface and trying to conserve _fuel_ though --- not battery)
* [X] The Gnat has only singular diesel engine; while the Prospect is always running multiple diesel engines
* [X] find and remove 'inches' and 'feet' references
* [X] find 'map' replace with 'chart'
* [X] find 'floor' should be 'deck'
* [-] Change Owen to Owens?
	* Leaning away from making this change


### Specific scenes to fix:
:scenes:
-------------------------------------------------
#### Preface:
* [X] Do another pass through and edit -- it's only been through once so far and it's pretty rough
	* See in-line notes about shifting from generational focus to technology change focus

#### Beginning:
* [X] Give Hemi a beard, like he's captain Nemo. 
	* The idea is that someone who didn't know better might mistake him for the captain
	* Maori men in the 19th C they would often grow them to cover facial tatoos. So Hemi with a beard would have some significance.
* [X] Add a minor misdirect at the beginning of the book where someone might mistake Hemi for the captain
	* [X] This could be where you add a clearer description of Hemi earlier in the book.
	* Maybe he is the first one to climb up onto the bridge
	* [X] Could also be Shakes who mistakes him for the captain
* [X] bring Sylvia's first name into the story. it's too repetitive to refer to her without it.
	* though maybe Hemi is the only one who calls her by it
* [ ] Need to include a description of Percy somewhere early in the book
	* (There's the line about the leather pants she's wearing when she's kneeling on the grates; this might need to be moved up into or reflected in description of her)
	* [ ] Subtly reinforce Percy's beauty in more places:
		* Right now I think she reads more like the elder captain she will be in later stories
		* Other characters should sometimes react to her youth and beauty --- but she has no interest in that herself.
		* The older version of her (see character notes) was really for being a role model for Shakes. That isn't in this first book. Maybe later.
* [X] Does Percy need to tell Hemi about the ram on the sub? 
	* She does.

#### Seamount:
* [X] Add 'blatting' to description of authority announcement over ship-to-ship
* [X] Go back and hit the symbolism of the boat landed on the mountaintop a little harder.
* [X] fix creeping towards the seamount:
	* I think creeping allows the batteries to last long, but if you're going for distance, you can probably go at speed.
	* Though they would creep anyway because of the pursuing sub
* [X] Would they waste electricity on cooking if they were very low on power?
	* I'm just not going to address this in the text
* [X] fix the bumpers stored on deck outside pressure hull?
	* Seems like maybe they should not be the inflatey kind
	* Bastian inflates them from a low-pressure fixture. that seems like a cool solution
* [ ] make sure you only explain active sonar once
	* [ ] Make sure it's clear that the ping is the sound of 'active' sonar. Describe the sound of the ping
* [ ] Percy should have a captain's chair in the control room. Or at least a station she stands at.
	* (I think her standing station gets established later in the story, make sure it makes sense in the earlier parts of the book)
	* maybe refer to it explicitly as the 'captain's station'? (akin to the sonar station and the navigation station)
* [ ] make sure you make it clear early on that Hemi is the 'Deck Boss'
* [ ] mention that the navigation table is lit from underneath? (Is it? or is it just a well-lit station?)
* [ ] Is the PA one ship-wide system? Or does it go to different specific compartments? Or both?
	* decide, edit and then make sure it's reflected in the Prospect notes file
* [X] Is it a 'mating collar' or a 'docking collar'?
	* Let's say 'mating collar' --- docking collar feels like a bigger mechanism to me
* [X] Fix that the Gnat's mating collar should be _inside_ the Prospect's --- so it can be welded by Chips when it leaks. Also, seems more likely, like fitting a lego piece together or something.
	* Or like a _male_ anglerfish going into a _female_ socket.

#### Underwater depot
* [X] when they arrive at the underwater dock, have the two beefy guys extract a docking fee.
* [X] make sure Shakes doesn't give away that the depot is underwater earlier in the story since that's a mini-surprise
	* He doesn't
* [X] add Shakes chewing coca leaves again
* [X] make sure Shakes is fully informed of the sub with the ram when it chases them towards the depot --- he needs to know about it to fully report on it later
	* He's in the control room when Hemi asks Percy about the weirdness of the sub with the ram pursuing them specifically 
* [X] in the underwater depot: Is it a saloon, bar, pub, or canteen? be (mostly) consistent.
	* On the depot, it's a canteen.
* [X] Cassandra might have long fingernails that are painted and chipped; and short black curly hair
* [O] Fix Cassandra music references:
	* [X] the whores listen to a "record player"; drives the pimp crazy, but when he tried to get rid of it they all threw a fit; cassandra particularly loved it
	* [X] cassandra doesn't have a "practiced ear"
	* [X] cassandra finds the drone music "similar to some far foreign music, that uses drones to tap spirituality" (believable because she would have contact with far world cultures at the depot, but not really understand them)
* [X] emphasize the weight of the crates with the warheads earlier
	* (during the part where they are re-arranging the crates in the hold, seems like a good place for that)
	* (added in-line note to add this)
* [X] the sub with the ram probably identifies which Authority they are when they reach out the first time over ship-to-ship. But the crew acts like they don't know who they are later. Make sure this is consistent and makes sense.
	* dealt with this by making the Authority goons unwilling to state where they are from when they are in the depot --- outside their own jurisdiction.

#### storm:
* [X] add Shakes chewing coca leaves again
* [X] revisions for Gregory death scene:
	* blood rains down through the open hatch (though they don't see Gregory at all)
	* as they dive, shave-and-a-haircut, shave-and-a-haircut, shave-and-a-haircut taps out above them on the sail.
		* I can't go there. the scene is too dramatic. 
* [X] during the storm add something about the malevolent forces of nature trying to do them down (if it's not there already)
* [X] add the term 'scudding clouds' to description during storm
* [o] add something about Cassandra:
	* [ ] listening to music; 
	* [X] her big eyes; 
	* [X] operating the sonar with long fingernails
		* (she grips the sonar handles during the storm with her nails digging into her palms)

#### Stilt City:
* [X] make sure Shakes learns that Chips left the Prospect
* [X] make references to Shakes beginning to go deaf
* [X] make sure Shakes knows that Owen is the reason the sub with the ram is after them
	* Could be around like 4700, where they fill Shakes in on what he missed
	* But it feels like it would be better coming later as part of another convo

#### Not sure where:
* [ ] Add a scene where the outside landscape is detected on sonar:
	* huge sunken wrecked vehicles
	* maybe getting towards the gargbage gyre -- ships that have sunk
	* like the dream I had
* [ ] does the prospect have a record player? maybe they get one later. Maybe cassandra complains about the lack of one at some point, and that becomes your music reference for her.
* [X] Add? "They were only 100 meters under water, some people could kick a ball that distance"
* [ ] Add? "The way sound travels underwater is complex, sometimes almost magical."
	* Though there is already a line about how sound finds new and mysterious ways to propagate in the depths
* [ ] Add a conversation about the morality of running weapons parts when they have the magnetic mines aboard
	* Maybe with shakes over ship-to-ship, just to keep it interesting
	* Maybe Shakes wonders if it's moral to run weapons
	* But Percy points out that they might be supplying a rebel group fighting for their freedoms
	* Though that rebel group might be the oppressors in 6 months
	* There's no way to keep track of who is in power, or even if there actually CAN be someone in power
	* So instead just do the job at hand, and hope it all comes out as a moral wash in the long run
* [-] Consider having Owen and Percy get into a conflict, Owen wants to make one move with the Prospect and Percy is determined to do something else. Owen turns out to be right. Percy doesn't apologize
	* ...could also be Bastian for a little character development, but I think he remains just a skinny quiet smoking pole.
	* I like that this will play in later when they decide what to do when they find out that Owen slept with the ramming sub's captain's wife.
	* though maybe this human relations element is covered by the fight with Chips
* [ ] consider adding a conversation about tools and how a character prefers hand tools whenever they can get them.
* [X] When they make a random course decision, add:
	* Rand legend has it that a submarine commander used the book to set unpredictable courses to dodge enemy ships.
	* https://www.wsj.com/articles/rand-million-random-digits-numbers-book-error-11600893049
	* they do this in '### They run under the scattering layer'
* [X] Does Shakes smoke tons of pot? Is there a brick of weed on the Gnat?
	* Or cocaine? 
	* coca leaves? (He did come from a coffee farm)
	* also coca leaves give the suggestion of global commerce exchange
* [X] maybe say somewhere that they should think about installing a snorkel?
	* (So sub nerds who read the book understand that they don't have one)
* [X] do you gap a diesel engine spark plug?
	* diesels use 'glow' plugs if I remember correctly
	* this is when they are about to embark the depot
	* no spark plugs in a diesel, the glow plugs are just for starting; when the engine warms up, compression alone ignites the fuel
	* on a submarine, compressed air is used to turn the engine over to start it
* [X] add 'straight pipe' to the description of Shakes' exhaust after upgrade
* [X] consider changing Pylon City back to Stilt City --- it's more alliterative
* [X] Is the moon pool thing where they mate with the Gnat right? Wouldn't it be two atmospheres at the bottom of the Prospect (roughly 30 feet down), and already ruining the moon pool effect, at least without increasing the pressure in the Prospect? Or does the Prospect run slightly pressurized in general as a safety measure?
	* No, it would flood at 2 atmospheres (bottom of the boat) see: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-air-pressure-in-a-submarine
* [X] Sort out the accent for Chips
	* like feckin instead of fuckin
	* make it more lady-like: imagine an Irish farmer's wife with a foul tongue.
	* Maybe it's just something simple and non-specific, using compounds, or dropped h's or something
	* maybe it's too star treky cliche to have an engineer with an accent?

### General style stuff to address throughout:
-------------------------------------------------
:general:
* [ ] Fix motivation for chase:
	* (every reader comments on this -- none of them are getting your idea that the one-armed captain is just going through the motions for no reason other than not knowing what else to do)
	* A possibility: The sub with the ram is after them because a global bounty has been declared on illicit cargo subs.
		* The sub with the ram is a privateer, licensed to chase cargo subs, capture and take their cargo
		* It becomes a bit of a story about the wider world: shifting towards globalized markets, away from independent operators
		* give the one-armed captain back his arm
* [ ] Maybe have the Prospect painted striped black and white disruptive camo (look it up) -- because they are the white whale, they are the prey (zebra)?
* [ ] Add a scene where they quick-fix a leak with a Power Actuated Tool?
* [ ] Make a reference to the head --- a joke about how complex it is to operate.
* [ ] Have someone wash their hands with salt water soap
* [ ] Maybe have Bastian decorating his quarters with plants?
	* [ ] Ask A what plants could actually grow on a sub
* [ ] give chapters headers (but remove numbers, those are not doing anything -- but keep the number on the md file name so the order is easy t follow):
	1. Tablemount
	2. The _Gnat_
	3. Depot
	4. Herschel
	5. A Storm
	6. Stilt City
	7. Garbage Gyre
	8. Down The Hole
	* (Consider making much shorter chapters -- maybe breaks by scene?)
* [ ] You might have to reconsider "stacks blowing flame" --- diesel subs exhausted below the surface
	* (see notes in research files)
	* Maybe. There's an argument that a cargo sub might trade off a quieter under-water exhaust system for the fact that a diesel plume would be pretty hard to detect at night --- which is when they would do most of their surface-diesel running
		* This is the kind of thing that might be different about a cargo sub --- which presumably has less chance of being forced to the surface to run during the day. 
* [X] After full draft revisions are complete: scan through with spell check on; and make sure all listed spelling errors are intentional.
* [ ] After test-reader full round of edits: do a full scan through a different spellchecker, like libreoffice
* [ ] Feedback from Kevin:
	* [ ] motivation for Shakes isn't strong enough (see note about pot above --- maybe they can convince him to help out with a giant brick of pot? Maybe Bastian grows pot in his quarters, that's how they have enough to convince Shakes?)
* [ ] Feedback from Brian:
	* [ ] The start is slow, maybe pick up the writing pace a bit to match the speed of the rest of the book
		* (MT says: I think what happened here is at first I didn't know how much space everything was going to take, so I wrote longer scenes, but later had so many ideas to cram in that there wasn't space for longer scenes)
	* [ ] Cassandra says something like "I didn't realize when I agreed to this that it would be so boring" Which was maybe offensive she didn't agree since she was sold like a slave and she was escaping prositution. 
	* [ ] Some of the material handling scenes need work. People don't use a chain with a block. There is a thing called a chain hoist. You might also want to consider gantry cranes. A sub port isn't going to be fooling around.
	* [ ] There is a point where Shakes doesn't know the horsepower of the motors on his sub. That seems strange since he built it. But maybe it is intentional. 
	* [ ] You start using bearings at some point but there are places earlier where they could be used. 
	* [ ] There are a couple places in the first 15 or so pages where it is like "then this happened."  Along the line of show, don't tell, it should be something like "then Chips said to Hemi "there a X in the Y" and Hemi (did something)"
	* [ ] There are a couple of parts where the text tells the reader to appreciate something or that something is a mystery.  You could cut those and let the reader do the work
	* [ ] I felt that the air intake and exhaust were not handled when Gant was coupled to Prospect in Ch 1 or 2.
	* [ ] The sub port would be like a cup with air upside down underwater. Damage to the sub docking areas shouldn't cause flooding since the air is there, damage that would allow the air to escape would. But a large door would still be appropriate. 
		* NB: I thought about this during the first draft: the depot would be kept at 1 atmosphere so it could maintain open doors with the surface. That avoids the problem of keeping all those people in the depot at saturation (both in terms of decompression time and complexity for them to enter and exit the depot, but also for health reasons --- people with weaker bodies (Trinity) likely couldn't constantly be compressing and decompressing. (Though, maybe an interesting idea for Trinity to live a huge chunk of her life at compression?) Also the subs are at 1 atmosphere so even if the dock is only 30 feet down that means the dock air would be at 2 atmospheres and you'd have to equalize that with the docking subs. That's not just technically challenging, but the subs would not be designed to be pressurized to 2 atmosphere's from the INSIDE.
* [ ] Possible book (though not series) title:
	* :titles:
	* An Absolute and Blessed Silence
	* The Salted wound
		* (referring to the never-healing damage from the ramming at the beginning)
	* The Mouse's Wheel
	* Echoes in the Deep / Echos From the Deep
	* Deep Blue Fever
		* (or something else that ties submarines and trucks together)
	* The turning screw
	* As the screw turns
	* A turn of the wheel
	* As the wheel turns
		* (wheel as in propeller)
	* propellerheads
	* Oceans of Oil
* [X] the pursuing sub is advanced diesel-electric, not nuclear. 
	* They occasionally run on the surface to recharge as well.
	* (in later stories, snorkels and nuclear subs come into play, but those are not widespread technologies yet) 
* [X] Add pigeon communication scene
* [X] add something explaining that the Prospect has no torpedo tubes:
	* "Can't we fire a torpedo at them?" Asked a naive youngster. "We're not a warship, we don't have torpedo tubes!" Replied Percy
* [ ] You need to _see_ the aesthetic of the grime in your head if you want to describe it; the same way you see the mechanical bits.
	* [ ] It isn't capturing the grittiness enough, build that up
	* The scene where Percy is looking at her hands and contemplates the grime worn into the creases of her knuckles is a good example of _seeing_ the grime. I need more of that.
* [X] Electric motor(s):
	* The Prospect has two, plural mostly, but there are places it runs on only one
	* the Gnat has a single motor
* [ ] there may be TOO much up and down from the control room. Maybe consider ditching the control room in the sail and put it in the same room as navigation and sonar.
	* Maybe all you need to do is remove the 'up' like: climbed into the control room, rather than: climbed up to the control room
* [ ] Consider removing parts where Percy second-guesses herself.
	* Hard to say: on the one hand it contributes the tension by having her doubt the outcome of her decisions
	* On the othe hand, you could have Hemi do the questioning (gently) and have Percy be insistent that she's right.
		* Might make for more interesting dialog
		* and Percy is NOT always right, just most of the time.
* [X] make sure you keep the navigation table and sonar oriented correctly to the control room (in my vision it was kinda in the wrong place -- nav and sonar are _forward_ of the hatch to the control room.)
* [X] Be clear about which person at the controls is the planesman and tank trimmer, and which is the throttle/rudder
	* (Tank trim panel should be reachable by the planesman, but also accessible by the deck boss)
		* (Maybe be sure to always refer to it as "the tank control panel")
	* planesman is left, tank trim panel is to their left. throttle/rudder is the right seat. (facing towards the bow)
	* [X] Make sure you don't have the throttle/rudder seat control the dive planes anywhere
* [X] make sure you are consistent about crew quarters and galley being on the middle deck (see diagram)
* [-] consider using 'nominal' to mean anything you want it to.
	* might be too on-the-nose
	* I've deleted it in all places the prose has it. left it once in dialog
* [X] Hemi calls Percy "Sylvia"; everyone else calls her captain
	* [X] Hemi uses Sylvia as a whole name exclusively, not Syl.
* [ ] have the junior crew call hemi 'boss'
* [ ] refer to Bastian, Gregory, and Owen as the 'deck crew'
* [X] does Shakes insist on being referred to as "Captain Shakes"?
* [X] Cassandra should always address Percy as "Captain Percy" and Shakes as "Captain Shakes"
* [ ] make sure any compass bearing degrees references are oriented to the globe, not relative to the boat
* [X] maybe they refer to the bottomless deep as 'the hole'
* [X] hatch in Prospect sail is at top of _control room_ not bottom of sail bridge
* [X] make sure welding refers to 'rigs' not 'tanks'
	* arc welding is used for underwater welding
	* which means that like the stove, they have to be careful about fuel/power consumption
	* the welding rig needs to run a generator or from boat power, I think
* [X] put in chapter breaks where they seem like they should go; even if you don't edit the text for the chapters until a later pass
* [X] audit 'and's --- 'it was a dark and stormy night': multiple descriptors compete for attention.
* [X] make sure the 'Said [someone]s' are only where you absolutely need them for clarity of who is talking.
* [ ] make consistent whether numbers are written out or not
	* I think I lean towards JUST using numerals. I don't love written-out numbers in text.
	* except zero --- that needs to be written out.
	* maybe the rule is: 
		* for numbers that are part of the 'language' of the piece (including one through ten, or maybe twenty? --- twenty is where you have to start hyphenating after all) you write them out
		* And numbers that are actual measurements of things (off gauges or whatever) are numerals
* [X] remove contractions from Hemi dialog
* [X] when they call Hemi Hem' for short, make sure it has an apostrophe
* [ ] more strongly emphasize the feeling of _prey_. I think it feels like they are prey for the sub with the ram throughout the book, might as well explicitly double down on it.
* [ ] make sure the _fear_ is in there, particularly in the build up to big inflection points
* [X] Do you need to do more to pump up the human relations in the story?
	* Imagine that a resolution with Chips leads to something successfully happening at the end of the story
	* Or more generally, Percy's has a stubborn insistence throughout the book that she's right, and it leads to some conflict that needs resolution.
	* On the other hand, I don't like the idea that human actions/emotions are rational, follow a path, or are even knowable; or that conflict can be resolved with a motivating speech or resolution between two characters. Beyond just seeming cliche, life never works like that.
	* How then to assure the human interest, and at the same time avoid a cliche character conflict arc?
		* Think about how things play out on Deadliest Catch. Sometimes the motivational speech works... often it doesn't.
* [X] keep an eye out for military terms --- avoid
	* [X] like generally, you want to remove the word 'orders'
* [ ] Consider adding more description of the spaces --- particularly inside the Prospect
	* How is it decorated?
	* What does it _feel_ like?
	* How is the galley laid out?
	* What does the engine room feel like?
	* What does the sonar compartment and control room feel like? (You spend so much time in those spaces)
	* (I think the cargo hold is fairly well covered, it's the main decks that are a little weak)
* [ ] watch the pacing, it's a little off in places:
	* [ ] it should be a slow build up to a big singular event like the ballast blow
	* [ ] And it should be a draw-out grind in a staring-at-dials scene that goes hauls the tension along relentlessly
	* [ ] fill in the time-passing sections with something to pull the pacing along at a slow but steady rate, 
		* don't just montage over them, it makes it feel like things are moving too fast.
* [ ] Keep in mind that in this world, like the opening set piece, nature is deliberately cruel and evil, tormenting
	* So at some point, it should be _pulling_ them to the depths
	* akin to the cruelty and evil of power --- the Authorities; but where the Authority cruelty is random, nature's cruelty is deliberate
	* The only way they survive in nature's cruelty is through their grimey, rational machine, the submarine. the submarine which always makes sense, if you can just figure it out
* [X] 'navigation station'? 'navigation table'?
	* Seems like this doesn't need to be corrected if it sounds right in text: there can be a navigation table at the navigation station
* [-] consider using 'nautical' to mean awesome 
	* (dark-awesome, like original meaning maybe)
	* might be too on-the-nose
* [X] does 'transport' indicate the transport of people? Should you more rigorously use 'cargo ship'?
* [X] Black sub should probably be referred to as the sub with the ram. (virtually all subs are black, cept the ones that are gray)


## Elements specific to this story
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:elements:
* [ ] Hemi has stacks of books crammed into his rack (which is larger than most both because he's deck boss, and he's huge. (maybe he became deck boss _primarily_ for the larger rack. He's not one who _wants_ leadership).
	* [ ] A scene where he is reading The Recognitions (describe cover, not name title.) 
* [X] Maybe in some battle situation, they can use 3D thinking to outwit some smart enemy who is limited to 2D thinking. (ala kahn in star trek 2)
	* Let's say this is the section where they go deep to escape the sub as they leave the depot
* [ ] long slow chase scene akin to O'Brian books. they run until the batteries run out and they have to surface. on the surface they are saved from being seen by a fog bank (so they are just as, if not more, blind above water as below) 
	* It would be nice to make this the _first_ story because it has all the elements of The Enemy Below. It's archetypal for a submarine story, and at the same time can introduce all styles and characters you want to use.  
* [ ] fuel oil -- is what fuel is called
* [ ] fuel ballast -- normal fuel oil tanks are filled with water as they are emptied (since they are outside the pressure hull)
	* fuel ballast tanks (not sure if these are extras, see USS Cod website) can be filled with air to get additional freeboard and run faster on the surface
	* don't forget that in non-teardrop subs, the lower they are the slower they go on the surface.
* [X] someone fishes from the deck of the ship
* [X] The contrast between the noisy fast mini sub, and the quiet slow smugglers sub.
* [X] the pilot blows the tanks on the gnat and breaches the sub to attract attention of the authorities
* [X] they separate from the gnat and have to give it a depth and location and time to meet for a rendezvous under silence
* [X] They have a conversation about whether mice enjoy running on wheels:
	* "if you put a wheel in the woods, do you think mice would run on it?"
	* "I'll bet they would --- for the sheer mechanical pleasure of it. Like a bicycle. Or a submarine"
	* (I originally had this slated for book II though.. is it better there?)
* [X] My submarine book (at least this first one and the free 10k word story) will NOT have a 'running out of air' scene.
* [X] make sure you explain somewhere that 10 meters = 1 atmosphere of pressure
	* But under water every ten meters down added another atmosphere of pressure to the hull. The equivalent of another entire column of the weight of the air on the surface pressing down from space. And against that had to stand the measly one atmosphere of pressure inside the _Grimlock_ plus the noble strength of the steel hull. When approaching the maxiumum depth of a sub, one small adjustment in the wrong direction of the huge planing fins that guided the sub up or down, or one valve accidentally left partially open and flooding a ballast tank could take them down that last critical ten meters in a matter of seconds.
* [X] overall theme: being chased by a dark force of evil (black sub) from place to place to place
* [X] plot milestones
	* on a dead calm sea
	* rammed and sunk on the top of a seamount (like Moses on Ararat) 
	* a depot (for repairs and pick up cargo)
	* on the surface in a storm (wave porn -- the sub sneaks up on them because they can't hear them over the crashers)
	* hiding in the depths, escape under the deep scattering layer
	* Into an exotic remote city with junks everywhere; homes built on stilts; the metal machine tooling through rickety wood structures; unload cargo at port
	* bicycle race in the hangar
	* into the pacific garbage patch; the final battle
* [X] bottomed on a seamount
	* A 'guyot' or tablemount
	* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyot
* [X] They visit depots that have staging areas above ground on the coast, and underwater sub connections for loading and unloading goods.
* [X] they do deadliest catch style shifts of more than 24 hours with everyone exhausted (mine from that 33 minute episode of battlestar gallactica)
	* no sleep
	* lots of crew doing cocaine or unnamed but clearly doing stimulants
	* bloodshot eyes, mistakes from tiredness
	* the captain struggles to get the crew into the rack reasonably often
* [X] in a desperate underwater chase, they have to run the big sub off the mini sub's batteries, by stringing essentially huge jumper cables through the ship and up into the mated mini sub
* [X] An authority sub or ship is equipped with a battering ram
* [X] deep scattering layer move:
	* {They head down towards the deep scattering layer --- the instruments telling them they are going to hit the bottom, hard. But Percy knows instinctively that it's just billions of tiny fish --- the "bottom" has a particular sound on sonar.}
	* {They pass through the deep scattering layer, and get away from the enemy who thinks they disappeared on the bottom... though not hearing them crash would need to be resolved somehow --- maybe this is how you can work the Gnat back into it? Percy has the Gnat buzz past to overwhelm their ears just when the pass through the deep scattering layer?}
	* ~~On Authority sub: "I see nothing but the bottom on the scope" "that's not the bottom, that's the deep scattering layer. they are hiding under it."~~
* [X] Deck boss/nerd character figures out to use magnetic mines and some kind of float to put the mines in the path of the chasing authority sub. 
	* the nerd character calculates by hand how much psi to put in the float so the mine sits at the depth of the chasing sub. they fill the floats by hand and launch them out the airlock into the path of the chasing sub.
* [X] the nerd character might be able to listen to the water mics and determine size and types of ships by screw rpms or something?
* [X] The mini sub in some situation wants to create even more noise, so they make some kind of adjustment to the engines to run clackily or something.
* [X] at some point have one of the characters dip a comb in engine grease and run it through their hair
* [X] they have a pile of crappy old (pre-war) bicycles, when the cargo bay is clear, they have donut races like the Seven xmas party:
* [X] possibly the gnat has a window for hand-steering? (How did the rescue sub in red october know where it was precisely enough to hit a mating collar?)
* [X] someone says sub-marine like it's two words. maybe a trader in a depot or something.
	* (because submarine is such a strange mush of a word to say) 
* [X] They battle a giant storm, and can't submerge for some reason
	* At one point the engines swamp and suck all the air out of the boat and pump in diesel fumes
	* The boat goes over on its side:
		* A long time passes while it's on its side. The heavy ballast at the bottom of the boat trying to set their gravitational desires right. "Jesus, will it come back upright?" "She'll come back up. They always come back up. Well, almost always"
* [X] A conversation about why salmon cans are shaped with an angle:
	* Because the can rolls in a circle on the floor!
		* Shakes is the one who suggests this
		* "I wish I could all cans like this. I hate it when a can falls over in the Gnat and rolls forward where I can't get it."
	* No, cuz they can stack more cans in the hold of a ship
* [X] They use dead reckoning to navigate, and have to correct their location with celestial sitings at night.  


## style 
:style: 
* manliness:
	* One thing I'm trying to do in this book is salvage the lone-male fantasy
		* First by making it not exclusively "male"
		* Second by doing it without guns (1970s trucker movies are a perfect fit for that)
	* See this article: https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/04/opinion/guns-america-western-mythology.html 
		* For a good outline of what's wrong with the male fantasy, including Cormac McCarthy 
	* One of my test readers criticized the book for being too "male"; 
		* But I believe the individualist male fantasy is validly compelling; it just needs to be adapted to not be racist, sexist, capitalist, and nationalist.
		* Keep the violence though.
	* Also life on the barren frontier (mentioned in article above):
		* Deadliest Catch does this too: the individual out in the frontier landscape, their wits against mother nature
			* (ignoring the gun nuts on the show) 
		* This is *important* work because Deadliest Catch is redeeming the male myth, without recourse to killing brown people with weapons.
		* Redeeming the lone male myth is the BEST way to address the problems with it.
* [ ] Consider pulling back or deleting the metaphors
* [ ] Add a lot of broken things:
	* Like, have characters on their down time working on repairing all sorts of stuff
	* And for transitional passages, give a list of things repaired
* [ ] Contrast the sound and smoke and roughness of the diesels running with the quiet and elegance of the electrics motors on batteries
	* [ ] also the relationship between the black smoke pouring off the diesels and the cigarillo/cigarette smoke
* 'feminine' qualities vs 'masculine' qualities --- women who live on a dirty machine
* [X] try putting in more cursing. Maybe it seems like it's hard to do it genuinely. but on the other hand, maybe all you have to do is _do_ it --- curses every third word.
	* I think TV has programmed you to think you can't use cursing so much. But even TV that doesn't shy away from cursing still has far less cursing than even average real life. (except Deadwood of course)
	* And a lot more cursing might actually be a simple way to make it grittier.
	* Also they're a bunch of fuckin sailors!
	* Maybe the only time they don't curse is when someone is _truly_ angry? (Or is it better to go like Steve on Deadwood at his angriest?)
		* **Like the note you read about 'fuck' during WWII: the only time it wasn't used was when something serious was happing: "Grab your [no-fucking] guns."**
		* I think this is a good revision to make. do it!
	* [X] Maybe Hemi is the one character who doesn't (normally/ever) curse?
		* Chips: curses all the time
		* Shakes: a lot
		* Percy: When she's pissed
		* Hemi: never
* fitzcorraldo: hauling explosive parts over a mountain
* remember to include a lot of spatial description: the reader should be able to SEE the sub/spaces in their head.  
	* build a map in their head for them.  
* there is an underlying idea that the machines of this world are rational and knowable. There is order to them, and the accessibility for most people to be able to understand how they work because they are logical. The world of machines makes sense. It is not wicked.
	* The layer above that is the world of the human mind: infinitely complex and unknowable. No person's motivation can be relied upon to be rational or logical (this is the untruth at the heart of so many novels and the discipline of acting --- writers/storytellers use simplified/simplistic human motivation as a shorthand to drive stories. It's not very real at all. ...On the other hand I think it makes it easier to create compelling characters (Shakes?) and drive them through a plot.) 
* Just make the first submarine novel GO: 
	* Go for character-driven (fear) excitement through staring at dials 
	* This first book should be the pop novel: readable, accessible, character-driven 
	* Go for descriptive renderings of sounds, and on the rare occasions it merits it, sights 
	* accessibility is more important than style: 
		* do NOT fall into the trap of keeping things abstract for the sake of style. those books are often (and often rightfully) unpopular.
		* on the other hand layering style on top of accessibility is the dream: like Batman
* maybe with the engine running full blast, it SOUNDS heavy and grimy, like Dopesmoker.
	* try to think about what a listener to dopesmoker would want to read. 
* think carefully about where you "dive" into description:
	* character's clothing, for example, should just be mentioned in casual passing: "she placed the pencil into the front pocket of her cracking leather overalls."
	* but you might want to go all-in with description when they are staring at dials under pressure.
* remember to focus on _description_ of the grime, darkness, cold, hardness. Make it feel like Deadwood or Blood Meridian, though with good story. Do NOT make it feel like a sci-fi or naval/military story.
* consider NOT having any exterior shots. 
	* it may help the sense of isolation and being in a can if all action takes place _inside_ (the depot, the _Prospect_, the _Gnat_) 
	* having considered this, where I do have exterior shots so far I really like them. I'm not getting rid of them.
	* Though perhaps they end up being the exception that proves the rule.
* Even though it would have been cool to have people communicating on the boat through tubes, that's really a 19th century thing, and I think for where these boats are at, historically, it would just have to be intercoms.

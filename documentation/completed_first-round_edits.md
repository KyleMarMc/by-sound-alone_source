# Completed first-round edits
* [Find-and-fix editing](#fnf)
* [Scenes to fix](#scenes)


### Find-and-fix Editing (do these before full edit pass):
-------------------------------------------------
:fnf:
* [X] Do a pass through and search for # ( in the final published version -- comments: they have a habit of showing up with even just a 'ticks' and have low tolerance for any formatting or anything.
* [X] Search for buoyancy and make sure it is spelled correctly
* [X] write out full draft for preface; revise; insert into book file
* [X] make sure you are consistent about 'explosive mines' 'explosive warheads' 'magnetic explosives' etc
* [X] remove any references to jesus or christ or heaven --- there is no heaven, only hell. A submariner either ends up in hell, or escapes it.
	* [X] no god-damning either: there is no god
* [X] cargo bay or cargo hold? 
	* I think it's a hold on a ship
	* The underwater docking bay on the island would be the cargo bay though
* [X] Have Percy address Hemi by his full name somewhere
	* (I think she does when she introduces him to Cassandra --- check)
* [X] 'crew quarters' not 'crew's quarters' (just because I like it better, not because I looked it up_
* [X] electric motors should be plural on the prospect --- it's a dual prop
	* (Cept, annoyingly for fnf editing, there's a section where they run on a single motor to conserve power --- this is when they are running on the surface and trying to conserve _fuel_ though --- not battery)
* [X] The Gnat has only singular diesel engine; while the Prospect is always running multiple diesel engines
* [X] find and remove 'inches' and 'feet' references
* [X] find 'map' replace with 'chart'
* [X] find 'floor' should be 'deck'
* [-] Change Owen to Owens?
	* Leaning away from making this change


### Specific scenes to fix:
:scenes:
-------------------------------------------------
#### Preface:
* [X] Do another pass through and edit -- it's only been through once so far and it's pretty rough
	* See in-line notes about shifting from generational focus to technology change focus

#### Beginning:
* [X] Give Hemi a beard, like he's captain Nemo. 
	* The idea is that someone who didn't know better might mistake him for the captain
	* Maori men in the 19th C they would often grow them to cover facial tatoos. So Hemi with a beard would have some significance.
* [X] Add a minor misdirect at the beginning of the book where someone might mistake Hemi for the captain
	* [X] This could be where you add a clearer description of Hemi earlier in the book.
	* Maybe he is the first one to climb up onto the bridge
	* [X] Could also be Shakes who mistakes him for the captain
* [X] bring Sylvia's first name into the story. it's too repetitive to refer to her without it.
	* though maybe Hemi is the only one who calls her by it
* [X] Does Percy need to tell Hemi about the ram on the sub? 
	* She does.

#### Seamount:
* [X] Add 'blatting' to description of authority announcement over ship-to-ship
* [X] Go back and hit the symbolism of the boat landed on the mountaintop a little harder.
* [X] fix creeping towards the seamount:
	* I think creeping allows the batteries to last long, but if you're going for distance, you can probably go at speed.
	* Though they would creep anyway because of the pursuing sub
* [X] Would they waste electricity on cooking if they were very low on power?
	* I'm just not going to address this in the text
* [X] fix the bumpers stored on deck outside pressure hull?
	* Seems like maybe they should not be the inflatey kind
	* Bastian inflates them from a low-pressure fixture. that seems like a cool solution

* [X] Is it a 'mating collar' or a 'docking collar'?
	* Let's say 'mating collar' --- docking collar feels like a bigger mechanism to me
* [X] Fix that the Gnat's mating collar should be _inside_ the Prospect's --- so it can be welded by Chips when it leaks. Also, seems more likely, like fitting a lego piece together or something.
	* Or like a _male_ anglerfish going into a _female_ socket.

#### Underwater depot
* [X] when they arrive at the underwater dock, have the two beefy guys extract a docking fee.
* [X] make sure Shakes doesn't give away that the depot is underwater earlier in the story since that's a mini-surprise
	* He doesn't
* [X] add Shakes chewing coca leaves again
* [X] make sure Shakes is fully informed of the sub with the ram when it chases them towards the depot --- he needs to know about it to fully report on it later
	* He's in the control room when Hemi asks Percy about the weirdness of the sub with the ram pursuing them specifically 
* [X] in the underwater depot: Is it a saloon, bar, pub, or canteen? be (mostly) consistent.
	* On the depot, it's a canteen.
* [X] Cassandra might have long fingernails that are painted and chipped; and short black curly hair
* [X] Fix Cassandra music references:
	* [X] the whores listen to a "record player"; drives the pimp crazy, but when he tried to get rid of it they all threw a fit; cassandra particularly loved it
	* [X] cassandra doesn't have a "practiced ear"
	* [X] cassandra finds the drone music "similar to some far foreign music, that uses drones to tap spirituality" (believable because she would have contact with far world cultures at the depot, but not really understand them)
* [X] emphasize the weight of the crates with the warheads earlier
	* (during the part where they are re-arranging the crates in the hold, seems like a good place for that)
	* (added in-line note to add this)
* [X] the sub with the ram probably identifies which Authority they are when they reach out the first time over ship-to-ship. But the crew acts like they don't know who they are later. Make sure this is consistent and makes sense.
	* dealt with this by making the Authority goons unwilling to state where they are from when they are in the depot --- outside their own jurisdiction.

#### storm:
* [X] add Shakes chewing coca leaves again
* [X] revisions for Gregory death scene:
	* blood rains down through the open hatch (though they don't see Gregory at all)
	* as they dive, shave-and-a-haircut, shave-and-a-haircut, shave-and-a-haircut taps out above them on the sail.
		* I can't go there. the scene is too dramatic. 
* [X] during the storm add something about the malevolent forces of nature trying to do them down (if it's not there already)
* [X] add the term 'scudding clouds' to description during storm
* [X] add something about Cassandra:
	* [X] her big eyes; 
	* [X] operating the sonar with long fingernails
		* (she grips the sonar handles during the storm with her nails digging into her palms)

#### Stilt City:
* [X] make sure Shakes learns that Chips left the Prospect
* [X] make references to Shakes beginning to go deaf
* [X] make sure Shakes knows that Owen is the reason the sub with the ram is after them
	* Could be around like 4700, where they fill Shakes in on what he missed
	* But it feels like it would be better coming later as part of another convo

#### Not sure where:
* [X] Add? "They were only 100 meters under water, some people could kick a ball that distance"
* [X] When they make a random course decision, add:
	* Rand legend has it that a submarine commander used the book to set unpredictable courses to dodge enemy ships.
	* https://www.wsj.com/articles/rand-million-random-digits-numbers-book-error-11600893049
	* they do this in '### They run under the scattering layer'
* [X] Does Shakes smoke tons of pot? Is there a brick of weed on the Gnat?
	* Or cocaine? 
	* coca leaves? (He did come from a coffee farm)
	* also coca leaves give the suggestion of global commerce exchange
* [X] maybe say somewhere that they should think about installing a snorkel?
	* (So sub nerds who read the book understand that they don't have one)
* [X] do you gap a diesel engine spark plug?
	* diesels use 'glow' plugs if I remember correctly
	* this is when they are about to embark the depot
	* no spark plugs in a diesel, the glow plugs are just for starting; when the engine warms up, compression alone ignites the fuel
	* on a submarine, compressed air is used to turn the engine over to start it
* [X] add 'straight pipe' to the description of Shakes' exhaust after upgrade
* [X] consider changing Pylon City back to Stilt City --- it's more alliterative
* [X] Is the moon pool thing where they mate with the Gnat right? Wouldn't it be two atmospheres at the bottom of the Prospect (roughly 30 feet down), and already ruining the moon pool effect, at least without increasing the pressure in the Prospect? Or does the Prospect run slightly pressurized in general as a safety measure?
	* No, it would flood at 2 atmospheres (bottom of the boat) see: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-air-pressure-in-a-submarine
* [X] Sort out the accent for Chips
	* like feckin instead of fuckin
	* make it more lady-like: imagine an Irish farmer's wife with a foul tongue.
	* Maybe it's just something simple and non-specific, using compounds, or dropped h's or something
	* maybe it's too star treky cliche to have an engineer with an accent?

# Completed first-round edits
* [Find-and-fix editing](#fnf)
* [Scenes to fix](#scenes)
* [General stuff to keep in mind](#general)
* [Book 1 elements](#elements)


### Find-and-fix Editing (do these before full edit pass):
-------------------------------------------------
:fnf:
* [X] Do a pass through and search for # ( in the final published version -- comments: they have a habit of showing up with even just a 'ticks' and have low tolerance for any formatting or anything.
* [X] Search for buoyancy and make sure it is spelled correctly
* [X] write out full draft for preface; revise; insert into book file
* [X] make sure you are consistent about 'explosive mines' 'explosive warheads' 'magnetic explosives' etc
* [X] remove any references to jesus or christ or heaven --- there is no heaven, only hell. A submariner either ends up in hell, or escapes it.
	* [X] no god-damning either: there is no god
* [X] cargo bay or cargo hold? 
	* I think it's a hold on a ship
	* The underwater docking bay on the island would be the cargo bay though
* [X] Have Percy address Hemi by his full name somewhere
	* (I think she does when she introduces him to Cassandra --- check)
* [X] 'crew quarters' not 'crew's quarters' (just because I like it better, not because I looked it up_
* [X] electric motors should be plural on the prospect --- it's a dual prop
	* (Cept, annoyingly for fnf editing, there's a section where they run on a single motor to conserve power --- this is when they are running on the surface and trying to conserve _fuel_ though --- not battery)
* [X] The Gnat has only singular diesel engine; while the Prospect is always running multiple diesel engines
* [X] find and remove 'inches' and 'feet' references
* [X] find 'map' replace with 'chart'
* [X] find 'floor' should be 'deck'
* [-] Change Owen to Owens?
	* Leaning away from making this change


### Specific scenes to fix:
:scenes:
-------------------------------------------------
#### Preface:
* [X] Do another pass through and edit -- it's only been through once so far and it's pretty rough
	* See in-line notes about shifting from generational focus to technology change focus

#### Beginning:
* [X] Give Hemi a beard, like he's captain Nemo. 
	* The idea is that someone who didn't know better might mistake him for the captain
	* Maori men in the 19th C they would often grow them to cover facial tatoos. So Hemi with a beard would have some significance.
* [X] Add a minor misdirect at the beginning of the book where someone might mistake Hemi for the captain
	* [X] This could be where you add a clearer description of Hemi earlier in the book.
	* Maybe he is the first one to climb up onto the bridge
	* [X] Could also be Shakes who mistakes him for the captain
* [X] bring Sylvia's first name into the story. it's too repetitive to refer to her without it.
	* though maybe Hemi is the only one who calls her by it
* [X] Does Percy need to tell Hemi about the ram on the sub? 
	* She does.

#### Seamount:
* [X] Add 'blatting' to description of authority announcement over ship-to-ship
* [X] Go back and hit the symbolism of the boat landed on the mountaintop a little harder.
* [X] fix creeping towards the seamount:
	* I think creeping allows the batteries to last long, but if you're going for distance, you can probably go at speed.
	* Though they would creep anyway because of the pursuing sub
* [X] Would they waste electricity on cooking if they were very low on power?
	* I'm just not going to address this in the text
* [X] fix the bumpers stored on deck outside pressure hull?
	* Seems like maybe they should not be the inflatey kind
	* Bastian inflates them from a low-pressure fixture. that seems like a cool solution

* [X] Is it a 'mating collar' or a 'docking collar'?
	* Let's say 'mating collar' --- docking collar feels like a bigger mechanism to me
* [X] Fix that the Gnat's mating collar should be _inside_ the Prospect's --- so it can be welded by Chips when it leaks. Also, seems more likely, like fitting a lego piece together or something.
	* Or like a _male_ anglerfish going into a _female_ socket.

#### Underwater depot
* [X] when they arrive at the underwater dock, have the two beefy guys extract a docking fee.
* [X] make sure Shakes doesn't give away that the depot is underwater earlier in the story since that's a mini-surprise
	* He doesn't
* [X] add Shakes chewing coca leaves again
* [X] make sure Shakes is fully informed of the sub with the ram when it chases them towards the depot --- he needs to know about it to fully report on it later
	* He's in the control room when Hemi asks Percy about the weirdness of the sub with the ram pursuing them specifically 
* [X] in the underwater depot: Is it a saloon, bar, pub, or canteen? be (mostly) consistent.
	* On the depot, it's a canteen.
* [X] Cassandra might have long fingernails that are painted and chipped; and short black curly hair
* [X] Fix Cassandra music references:
	* [X] the whores listen to a "record player"; drives the pimp crazy, but when he tried to get rid of it they all threw a fit; cassandra particularly loved it
	* [X] cassandra doesn't have a "practiced ear"
	* [X] cassandra finds the drone music "similar to some far foreign music, that uses drones to tap spirituality" (believable because she would have contact with far world cultures at the depot, but not really understand them)
* [X] emphasize the weight of the crates with the warheads earlier
	* (during the part where they are re-arranging the crates in the hold, seems like a good place for that)
	* (added in-line note to add this)
* [X] the sub with the ram probably identifies which Authority they are when they reach out the first time over ship-to-ship. But the crew acts like they don't know who they are later. Make sure this is consistent and makes sense.
	* dealt with this by making the Authority goons unwilling to state where they are from when they are in the depot --- outside their own jurisdiction.

#### storm:
* [X] add Shakes chewing coca leaves again
* [X] revisions for Gregory death scene:
	* blood rains down through the open hatch (though they don't see Gregory at all)
	* as they dive, shave-and-a-haircut, shave-and-a-haircut, shave-and-a-haircut taps out above them on the sail.
		* I can't go there. the scene is too dramatic. 
* [X] during the storm add something about the malevolent forces of nature trying to do them down (if it's not there already)
* [X] add the term 'scudding clouds' to description during storm
* [X] add something about Cassandra:
	* [X] her big eyes; 
	* [X] operating the sonar with long fingernails
		* (she grips the sonar handles during the storm with her nails digging into her palms)

#### Stilt City:
* [X] make sure Shakes learns that Chips left the Prospect
* [X] make references to Shakes beginning to go deaf
* [X] make sure Shakes knows that Owen is the reason the sub with the ram is after them
	* Could be around like 4700, where they fill Shakes in on what he missed
	* But it feels like it would be better coming later as part of another convo

#### Not sure where:
* [X] Add? "They were only 100 meters under water, some people could kick a ball that distance"
* [X] When they make a random course decision, add:
	* Rand legend has it that a submarine commander used the book to set unpredictable courses to dodge enemy ships.
	* https://www.wsj.com/articles/rand-million-random-digits-numbers-book-error-11600893049
	* they do this in '### They run under the scattering layer'
* [X] Does Shakes smoke tons of pot? Is there a brick of weed on the Gnat?
	* Or cocaine? 
	* coca leaves? (He did come from a coffee farm)
	* also coca leaves give the suggestion of global commerce exchange
* [X] maybe say somewhere that they should think about installing a snorkel?
	* (So sub nerds who read the book understand that they don't have one)
* [X] do you gap a diesel engine spark plug?
	* diesels use 'glow' plugs if I remember correctly
	* this is when they are about to embark the depot
	* no spark plugs in a diesel, the glow plugs are just for starting; when the engine warms up, compression alone ignites the fuel
	* on a submarine, compressed air is used to turn the engine over to start it
* [X] add 'straight pipe' to the description of Shakes' exhaust after upgrade
* [X] consider changing Pylon City back to Stilt City --- it's more alliterative
* [X] Is the moon pool thing where they mate with the Gnat right? Wouldn't it be two atmospheres at the bottom of the Prospect (roughly 30 feet down), and already ruining the moon pool effect, at least without increasing the pressure in the Prospect? Or does the Prospect run slightly pressurized in general as a safety measure?
	* No, it would flood at 2 atmospheres (bottom of the boat) see: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-air-pressure-in-a-submarine
* [X] Sort out the accent for Chips
	* like feckin instead of fuckin
	* make it more lady-like: imagine an Irish farmer's wife with a foul tongue.
	* Maybe it's just something simple and non-specific, using compounds, or dropped h's or something
	* maybe it's too star treky cliche to have an engineer with an accent?


### General style stuff to address throughout:
-------------------------------------------------
:general:
* [X] the pursuing sub is advanced diesel-electric, not nuclear. 
	* They occasionally run on the surface to recharge as well.
	* (in later stories, snorkels and nuclear subs come into play, but those are not widespread technologies yet) 
* [X] Add pigeon communication scene
* [X] add something explaining that the Prospect has no torpedo tubes:
	* "Can't we fire a torpedo at them?" Asked a naive youngster. "We're not a warship, we don't have torpedo tubes!" Replied Percy
* [X] Electric motor(s):
	* The Prospect has two, plural mostly, but there are places it runs on only one
	* the Gnat has a single motor
* [X] make sure you keep the navigation table and sonar oriented correctly to the control room (in my vision it was kinda in the wrong place -- nav and sonar are _forward_ of the hatch to the control room.)
* [X] Be clear about which person at the controls is the planesman and tank trimmer, and which is the throttle/rudder
	* (Tank trim panel should be reachable by the planesman, but also accessible by the deck boss)
		* (Maybe be sure to always refer to it as "the tank control panel")
	* planesman is left, tank trim panel is to their left. throttle/rudder is the right seat. (facing towards the bow)
	* [X] Make sure you don't have the throttle/rudder seat control the dive planes anywhere
* [X] make sure you are consistent about crew quarters and galley being on the middle deck (see diagram)
* [-] consider using 'nominal' to mean anything you want it to.
	* might be too on-the-nose
	* I've deleted it in all places the prose has it. left it once in dialog
* [X] Hemi calls Percy "Sylvia"; everyone else calls her captain
	* [X] Hemi uses Sylvia as a whole name exclusively, not Syl.
* [X] does Shakes insist on being referred to as "Captain Shakes"?
* [X] Cassandra should always address Percy as "Captain Percy" and Shakes as "Captain Shakes"
* [X] maybe they refer to the bottomless deep as 'the hole'
* [X] hatch in Prospect sail is at top of _control room_ not bottom of sail bridge
* [X] make sure welding refers to 'rigs' not 'tanks'
	* arc welding is used for underwater welding
	* which means that like the stove, they have to be careful about fuel/power consumption
	* the welding rig needs to run a generator or from boat power, I think
* [X] put in chapter breaks where they seem like they should go; even if you don't edit the text for the chapters until a later pass
* [X] audit 'and's --- 'it was a dark and stormy night': multiple descriptors compete for attention.
* [X] make sure the 'Said [someone]s' are only where you absolutely need them for clarity of who is talking.
* [X] remove contractions from Hemi dialog
* [X] when they call Hemi Hem' for short, make sure it has an apostrophe
* [X] Do you need to do more to pump up the human relations in the story?
	* Imagine that a resolution with Chips leads to something successfully happening at the end of the story
	* Or more generally, Percy's has a stubborn insistence throughout the book that she's right, and it leads to some conflict that needs resolution.
	* On the other hand, I don't like the idea that human actions/emotions are rational, follow a path, or are even knowable; or that conflict can be resolved with a motivating speech or resolution between two characters. Beyond just seeming cliche, life never works like that.
	* How then to assure the human interest, and at the same time avoid a cliche character conflict arc?
		* Think about how things play out on Deadliest Catch. Sometimes the motivational speech works... often it doesn't.
* [X] keep an eye out for military terms --- avoid
	* [X] like generally, you want to remove the word 'orders'
* [X] 'navigation station'? 'navigation table'?
	* Seems like this doesn't need to be corrected if it sounds right in text: there can be a navigation table at the navigation station
* [-] consider using 'nautical' to mean awesome 
	* (dark-awesome, like original meaning maybe)
	* might be too on-the-nose
* [X] does 'transport' indicate the transport of people? Should you more rigorously use 'cargo ship'?
* [X] Black sub should probably be referred to as the sub with the ram. (virtually all subs are black, cept the ones that are gray)


## Elements specific to this story
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:elements:
* [X] Maybe in some battle situation, they can use 3D thinking to outwit some smart enemy who is limited to 2D thinking. (ala kahn in star trek 2)
	* Let's say this is the section where they go deep to escape the sub as they leave the depot
* [X] someone fishes from the deck of the ship
* [X] The contrast between the noisy fast mini sub, and the quiet slow smugglers sub.
* [X] the pilot blows the tanks on the gnat and breaches the sub to attract attention of the authorities
* [X] they separate from the gnat and have to give it a depth and location and time to meet for a rendezvous under silence
* [X] They have a conversation about whether mice enjoy running on wheels:
	* "if you put a wheel in the woods, do you think mice would run on it?"
	* "I'll bet they would --- for the sheer mechanical pleasure of it. Like a bicycle. Or a submarine"
	* (I originally had this slated for book II though.. is it better there?)
* [X] My submarine book (at least this first one and the free 10k word story) will NOT have a 'running out of air' scene.
* [X] make sure you explain somewhere that 10 meters = 1 atmosphere of pressure
	* But under water every ten meters down added another atmosphere of pressure to the hull. The equivalent of another entire column of the weight of the air on the surface pressing down from space. And against that had to stand the measly one atmosphere of pressure inside the _Grimlock_ plus the noble strength of the steel hull. When approaching the maxiumum depth of a sub, one small adjustment in the wrong direction of the huge planing fins that guided the sub up or down, or one valve accidentally left partially open and flooding a ballast tank could take them down that last critical ten meters in a matter of seconds.
* [X] overall theme: being chased by a dark force of evil (black sub) from place to place to place
* [X] plot milestones
	* on a dead calm sea
	* rammed and sunk on the top of a seamount (like Moses on Ararat) 
	* a depot (for repairs and pick up cargo)
	* on the surface in a storm (wave porn -- the sub sneaks up on them because they can't hear them over the crashers)
	* hiding in the depths, escape under the deep scattering layer
	* Into an exotic remote city with junks everywhere; homes built on stilts; the metal machine tooling through rickety wood structures; unload cargo at port
	* bicycle race in the hangar
	* into the pacific garbage patch; the final battle
* [X] bottomed on a seamount
	* A 'guyot' or tablemount
	* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyot
* [X] They visit depots that have staging areas above ground on the coast, and underwater sub connections for loading and unloading goods.
* [X] they do deadliest catch style shifts of more than 24 hours with everyone exhausted (mine from that 33 minute episode of battlestar gallactica)
	* no sleep
	* lots of crew doing cocaine or unnamed but clearly doing stimulants
	* bloodshot eyes, mistakes from tiredness
	* the captain struggles to get the crew into the rack reasonably often
* [X] in a desperate underwater chase, they have to run the big sub off the mini sub's batteries, by stringing essentially huge jumper cables through the ship and up into the mated mini sub
* [X] An authority sub or ship is equipped with a battering ram
* [X] deep scattering layer move:
	* {They head down towards the deep scattering layer --- the instruments telling them they are going to hit the bottom, hard. But Percy knows instinctively that it's just billions of tiny fish --- the "bottom" has a particular sound on sonar.}
	* {They pass through the deep scattering layer, and get away from the enemy who thinks they disappeared on the bottom... though not hearing them crash would need to be resolved somehow --- maybe this is how you can work the Gnat back into it? Percy has the Gnat buzz past to overwhelm their ears just when the pass through the deep scattering layer?}
	* ~~On Authority sub: "I see nothing but the bottom on the scope" "that's not the bottom, that's the deep scattering layer. they are hiding under it."~~
* [X] Deck boss/nerd character figures out to use magnetic mines and some kind of float to put the mines in the path of the chasing authority sub. 
	* the nerd character calculates by hand how much psi to put in the float so the mine sits at the depth of the chasing sub. they fill the floats by hand and launch them out the airlock into the path of the chasing sub.
* [X] the nerd character might be able to listen to the water mics and determine size and types of ships by screw rpms or something?
* [X] The mini sub in some situation wants to create even more noise, so they make some kind of adjustment to the engines to run clackily or something.
* [X] at some point have one of the characters dip a comb in engine grease and run it through their hair
* [X] they have a pile of crappy old (pre-war) bicycles, when the cargo bay is clear, they have donut races like the Seven xmas party:
* [X] possibly the gnat has a window for hand-steering? (How did the rescue sub in red october know where it was precisely enough to hit a mating collar?)
* [X] someone says sub-marine like it's two words. maybe a trader in a depot or something.
	* (because submarine is such a strange mush of a word to say) 
* [X] They battle a giant storm, and can't submerge for some reason
	* At one point the engines swamp and suck all the air out of the boat and pump in diesel fumes
	* The boat goes over on its side:
		* A long time passes while it's on its side. The heavy ballast at the bottom of the boat trying to set their gravitational desires right. "Jesus, will it come back upright?" "She'll come back up. They always come back up. Well, almost always"
* [X] A conversation about why salmon cans are shaped with an angle:
	* Because the can rolls in a circle on the floor!
		* Shakes is the one who suggests this
		* "I wish I could all cans like this. I hate it when a can falls over in the Gnat and rolls forward where I can't get it."
	* No, cuz they can stack more cans in the hold of a ship
* [X] They use dead reckoning to navigate, and have to correct their location with celestial sitings at night.

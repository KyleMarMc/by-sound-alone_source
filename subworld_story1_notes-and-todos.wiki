# Subworld Story 1 --- notes and todos
* remember to include a lot of spatial description: the reader should be able to SEE the sub/spaces in their head. 
	* build a map in their head for them.
	* See notes on memory house in writing
* maybe with the engine running full blast, it SOUNDS heavy and grimey, like dopesmoker.
	* try to think about what a listener to dopesmoker would want to read. 
* think carefully about where you "dive" into description:
	* character's clothing, for example, should just be mentioned in casual passing: "she placed the pencil into the front pocket of her cracking leather overalls."
	* but you might want to go all-in with description when they are staring at dials under pressure.
* remember to focus on _description_ of the grime, darkness, cold, hardness. Make it feel like Deadwood or Blood Meridian, though with good story. Do NOT make it feel like a sci-fi or naval/military story.
* consider NOT having any exterior shots. 
	* it may help the sense of isolation and being in a can if all action takes place _inside_ (the depot, the _Prospect_, the _Gnat_)

## magnetic mines trading opening draft experiments

"Magnetic mines? What for?"

"Well, they're not actually magnetic mines. They are magnetic warheads
that can be fitted to a number of different delivery mechanisms like
torpedoes, placement arms, and yes mines."

"Why do you want to use our specialty shipping services? Why not just
ship them with a conventional authority transport?"

The dispatcher looked down at his clipboard before answering her
question.

"They aren't exactly destined for an authority stockpile, per se. They
need to be moved a little more under-the-radar, if you know what I
mean."

"Forget it. The less we know about their destination, the better."

---

"So you're asking us to move magnetic mines?" Captain Percy asked,
running a finger {let's avoid immediately revealing Percy is a woman}
down the oil-stained page attached to the black metal clipboard with
paint chipping off it.

"Magnetic warheads, to be precise. The units are agnostic about what
weapon they are installed in. Doesn't have to be a mine: could be a
torpedo, missile, suicide-bomber, sling-shot, whatever. The oceans these
days are teeming with rusting hulks that grind their way back and forth
across, and under, the surface of the Earth, leaving their silage [not
silage, what is that word?] of oil and carbon and noise trailing behind
them. And all of them are made of heavy, thick steel. There's more than
enough call for these things. Just deliver them to within a meter or two
of the sides of any of the beasts and _chunk_, _bam_, down goes your
target."

The verbosity on this guy disturbed Percy.

"So why us? Why not just ship them with conventional transport, stamped
and sealed by whichever Authority you are shipping them under? Or...
should I not ask?"

"Ah, yes. Well, as I mentioned, there is quite a demand for these...
tools. Many entities could put them to use, and many other entities
would sooner they didn't. Shipping under one Authority would only
attract the ire of some other Authority. Conventional shipping ends
up being an unwinnable game of tic-tac-toe with a high chance that
no matter how well stamped, sealed, and authorized a shipment like
this might be, it will simply never arrive at its destination due to,
shall we say, interference from another protagonist. The most reliable
way is to use a unit like yours, with your professional expertise at
clandestine maneuvering and your discreet interests. It's simply a
matter of reliability, you know. Nothing more."

"If we were any less reliable, I certainly wouldn't be standing here
talking to you right now.

## 'staring at dials' draft section
* {See style experiments in sub world shuttle bay for draft experiments of generalized scenes of going deep, staring at dials, listening. This section is for experimenting within the pseudocode 1.1 structure you already laid out.}

The _Prospect_ cruised on the uncanny oil-slick surface of the ocean, partially submerged, with just the sail slicing through the glassy surface and leaving a low wake behind them to mark their passage across this curved globe. They left the sail above so they could get the lookout mast as high as possible from the surface. In the lookout ring, Gregory clung, the hum of the diesels transmitted up the mast and crossed into the soles of his feet through the rusted metal grating he stood upon. With a pair of binoculars he scanned slowly around the horizon, but there was nothing to be seen but a flat circle of dark infinity, bisected with pure blackness on the lower half and almost-blackness on the upper half, like peeping into a viewport that looked into a frozen and unlit hell. 

Five meters below Gregory, Percy stood on the deck of the sail dressed in a black waxed overcoat with the collar turned up. The unvarying resonance of her boat mixed with the unvarying ripple of the wake they left behind and left her feeling numb, though the night was not very cold. The hatch at her feet stood open, and a faint red glow rose up through the open hole from the con.

"Anything Gregory?" She asked, more to break up the sensory deprivation than because she expected any kind of affirmative answer.

"No. If they are out there, they are dark as we are."

"And we're not going to hear them until we can turn off the diesels."

"How much longer, do you think, before we can submerge and go back on batteries?"

"Well, the longer we can run the diesels the better, obviously. And while it would charge them much faster, we can't run them hot and loud. It's all a game of how much charge we can put on the battery before being found out on the surface here. We need at least a few hours at this rate."

Through the open hatch they heard Schemey's voice coming statically over the mono speaker of the radio: "_Prospect_, _Prospect_, do you copy?" 

"I've got you Schemey. Over." 

"Yeah, you know, I managed to get them to chase me for an hour or so by running the _Gnat's_ engines hot and noisy, but they must have realized that I wasn't a transport sub because a few minutes ago they broke off and headed back in your direction. I assume to try to listen for you in a quieter place. Over."

"Hmm" Freddie said, "someone on their boat must have very good ears."

Percy came down the ladder and took the mic from Freddie.

"Schemey, this is Percy. I want you to keep running as you are. If they hear you continuing to move off, maybe they will doubt they made the right move by not following you. Over."

"That will give me a chance to charge up my batts too. Over."

"OK. I'll have Freddie figure out some reasonable rendezvous point and get back to you. Over out."

Percy hung the mic back up on the radio mounted above her and eased into her captain's chair trying to think of what to do next.

"What do you think Freddie?"

Freddie took a hanging rag and wiped the lenses of his pince-nez before placing them on the bridge of his nose and leaning over to look at the row of dials that showed the engine RPMs and battery charge.

"It is, of course, a matter of the chance of them finding us on the open ocean versus our ability to get our batteries charged. If they _do_ find us, we will need all the charge we can get. I think we need to assume they will fire on us again, and we will likely not get the warnings and negotiations we usually get from Authority ships."

"Goddamn violent motherfuckers. Someone needs to tell them the wars are over."

"Are they really?" Freddie asked.

"Let's not get into that again." Said Percy tiredly. "OK, lets start shutting the diesels down every half hour or so and do a careful listen. Maybe we'll manage to hear them before they get into any kind of firing range."

"Hard on the engines all that stopping and starting. Chips isn't going to like it."

"Chips won't like getting hit with a torpedo either. We can't just run deaf for hours on end, it's too risky."

"I'll go have a chat with her." Freddie said, and lowered his huge body down the ladder to the deck below.

Deep in the lower levels of the _Prospect_ the diesel engines fired their syncopated and timed explosions by the thousand. The pulses blended together and spun the dynamos that generated their searing force of electricity that was partially dumped straight into the giant motors that spun the greasy drive shafts, and partially flowed into the heavy leaded chemical concoctions that would store power for later. This cycle drove through the hole boat, in a slow ruminating bass rhythm that in one instance might lull a person almost to sleep, and in another distract them totally from what they were doing. In many cases it was a consoling drone of progress and maybe profit. In this case it was a cutting drone of fear.

# Subworld Story 1 --- notes and todos
* remember to include a lot of spatial description: the reader should be able to SEE the sub/spaces in their head. build a map in their head for them.
	* See notes on memory house in writing
* maybe with the engine running full blast, it SOUNDS heavy and grimey, like dopesmoker.
	* try to think about what a listener to dopesmoker would want to read.

# Subworld Story 1 --- notes and todos
* remember to include a lot of spatial description: the reader should be able to SEE the sub/spaces in their head. 
	* build a map in their head for them.
	* See notes on memory house in writing
* maybe with the engine running full blast, it SOUNDS heavy and grimey, like dopesmoker.
	* try to think about what a listener to dopesmoker would want to read. 
* think carefully about where you "dive" into description:
	* character's clothing, for example, should just be mentioned in casual passing: "she placed the pencil into the front pocket of her cracking leather overalls."
	* but you might want to go all-in with description when they are staring at dials under pressure.
* remember to focus on _description_ of the grime, darkness, cold, hardness. Make it feel like Deadwood or Blood Meridian, though with good story. Do NOT make it feel like a sci-fi or naval/military story.
* consider NOT having any exterior shots. 
	* it may help the sense of isolation and being in a can if all action takes place _inside_ (the depot, the _Prospect_, the _Gnat_)

### magnetic mines trading opening draft experiments

"Magnetic mines? What for?"

"Well, they're not actually magnetic mines. They are magnetic warheads
that can be fitted to a number of different delivery mechanisms like
torpedoes, placement arms, and yes mines."

"Why do you want to use our specialty shipping services? Why not just
ship them with a conventional authority transport?"

The dispatcher looked down at his clipboard before answering her
question.

"They aren't exactly destined for an authority stockpile, per se. They
need to be moved a little more under-the-radar, if you know what I
mean."

"Forget it. The less we know about their destination, the better."

---

"So you're asking us to move magnetic mines?" Captain Percy asked,
running a finger {let's avoid immediately revealing Percy is a woman}
down the oil-stained page attached to the black metal clipboard with
paint chipping off it.

"Magnetic warheads, to be precise. The units are agnostic about what
weapon they are installed in. Doesn't have to be a mine: could be a
torpedo, missile, suicide-bomber, sling-shot, whatever. The oceans these
days are teeming with rusting hulks that grind their way back and forth
across, and under, the surface of the Earth, leaving their silage [not
silage, what is that word?] of oil and carbon and noise trailing behind
them. And all of them are made of heavy, thick steel. There's more than
enough call for these things. Just deliver them to within a meter or two
of the sides of any of the beasts and _chunk_, _bam_, down goes your
target."

The verbosity on this guy disturbed Percy.

"So why us? Why not just ship them with conventional transport, stamped
and sealed by whichever Authority you are shipping them under? Or...
should I not ask?"

"Ah, yes. Well, as I mentioned, there is quite a demand for these...
tools. Many entities could put them to use, and many other entities
would sooner they didn't. Shipping under one Authority would only
attract the ire of some other Authority. Conventional shipping ends
up being an unwinnable game of tic-tac-toe with a high chance that
no matter how well stamped, sealed, and authorized a shipment like
this might be, it will simply never arrive at its destination due to,
shall we say, interference from another protagonist. The most reliable
way is to use a unit like yours, with your professional expertise at
clandestine maneuvering and your discreet interests. It's simply a
matter of reliability, you know. Nothing more."

"If we were any less reliable, I certainly wouldn't be standing here
talking to you right now.

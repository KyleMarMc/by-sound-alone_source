# Subworld Story 1 --- general notes and todos
* [notes and todos](#notes)
* [post-production editing notes](#post-prod)
* [story 1 elements](#elements)
* [style](#style)
* [On writing this book](onwriting)


## Notes and To dos:
:notes:
* [X] Draw diagrams of the Prospect and Gnat. Include with story.
	* (Possibly by scanning and modifying from US Subs book Tang drawings in Inkscape) 
	* (No copyright problems, those are federal gov't drawings)
	* (People like me eat that ship up --- it lets you visualize where in the boat the people are at any time.)
* [ ] be sure to return story elements and ideas that aren't used in this story to the general shuttlebay pile
	* [ ] Also if anything is leftover in this notes and todos section too
	* [ ] and also draw anything out of post-production that applies to the whole world
* [ ] Possible story (though not series) title:
	* The Salted wound
	* Echoes in the Deep / Echos From the Deep
	* (referring to the never-healing damage from the ramming at the beginning)
* Making the call: the pursuing sub is advanced diesel-electric, not nuclear. 
	* They occasionally run on the surface to recharge as well.
	* (in later stories, snorkels and nuclear subs come into play, but those are not widespread technologies yet) 
* [ ] when they arrive at the underwater dock, have the two beefy guys extract a docking fee.
* [ ] Add a conversation about the morality of running weapons parts when they have the magnetic mines aboard
	* Maybe with shakes over ship-to-ship, just to keep it interesting
	* Maybe Shakes wonders if it's moral to run weapons
	* But Percy points out that they might be supplying a rebel group fighting for their freedoms
	* Though that rebel group might be the oppressors in 6 months
	* There's no way to keep track of who is in power, or even if there actually CAN be someone in power
	* So instead just do the job at hand, and hope it all comes out as a moral wash in the long run
* [X] Add pigeon communication scene
* [X] add something explaining that the Prospect has no torpedo tubes:
	* "Can't we fire a torpedo at them?" Asked a naive youngster. "We're not a warship, we don't have torpedo tubes!" Replied Percy
* [X] do you want to have a more exciting opening ala Mickey Spillane --- start in the middle of some violence?
	* If you want to try to sell it as a novel before finishing it, this might help pitch the book
* For story description: 
	* "For them, the only way to know the difference between living and dying is the small movement of a needle on a gauge."
	* "Commerce always finds a way."
	* Set in an alternate-timeline post-WWII Earth, where a combination of cold and hot wars have ground the entire surface of the planet down to a military-bureaucratic morass making free movement nearly impossible, commerce has found a way in the form of a network of semi-clandestine transport submarines that take advantage of the freedom of movement offered by the vast three-dimensional space offered by moving cargo underwater.
	* {at front of book}:
		* _We live in a world today where technology is on the verge of magic. Only an elite few understand any givine technology. It wasn't always like this. At one time technology was a rising force in our culture, but it was knowable. Any person of average intelligence who wanted to understand how things worked could figure it out. That isn't the world we live in today, and there is no way we could return to that world. However, it is possible to imagine a world where technology remained knowable. Such a world could be a setting for telling amazing stories. This is such a story._
		* _Here in the 21st Century we live with technology that is almost magical in its complexity. But there was a time, not so long ago, when technology was ascendent but was also something that anyone could understand. It was complex but it's roots were electro-mechanical. Even the most complicated machine could be taken apart and comprehended through diligent common sense. We no longer live in that world, but there's no reason we couldn't have. This is a story from that other technological path we could have taken, but didn't._

## Editing notes (be sure to hit these in post-production editing):
:post-prod:
* [ ] GO THROUGH AND HANDLE THESE _BEFORE_ YOU DO A COMPLETE DRAFT READ-THROUGH
	* So when you do a read-through you can make sure order and flow didn't get screwed up anywhere by these edits
* [ ] move section headers to .md comments; create chapter breaks
* [ ] hatch in Prospect sail is at top of _control room_ not sail
* [ ] maybe they refer to the bottomless deep as 'the hole'
* [ ] cargo bay or cargo hold? (Fix on diagram too)
	* I think it's a hold on a ship
* [ ] bring Sylvia's first name into the story. it's too repetitive to refer to her without it.
	* tough maybe Hemi is the only one who calls her by it
* [ ] Have Percy address Hemi by his full name somewhere
* [ ] make sure you make it clear early on that Hemi is the 'deck boss'
* [ ] refer to bastian, gregory, and Owen as the 'deck crew'
* [ ] make sure Shakes doesn't give away that the depot is underwater earlier in the story since that's a mini-surprise
* [ ] Be clear about which person at the controls is the planesman and tank trimmer, and which is the throttle/rudder
	* (Tank trim panel should be reachable by the planesman, but also accessible by the deck boss)
		* (Maybe be sure to always refer to it as "the tank control panel")
* [ ] while the name _Gnat_ works, I keep having my doubts about _Prospect_.
	* P felt right when I first started using it, but feels less right as I go along
	* This might be a thing to ask test-reader's feedback on
* [ ] Give Hemi a beard, like he's captain Nemo. 
	* The idea is that someone who didn't know better might mistake him for the captain
	* or viking braids?
	* Do Maori men grow beards? Maybe no beard
* [-] Change Owen to Owens?
	* Leaning away from making this change
* [ ] 'crew quarters' not 'crew's quarters' (just because I like it better, not because I looked it up_
* [ ] make sure you are consistent about crew quarters and galley being on the middle deck (see diagram)
* [ ] make sure you don't 'shut down' the electric motors, just that they are either running with the diesels powering them, or with the batteries powering them.
* [ ] 'navigation station'? 'navigation table'?
* [ ] in the underwater depot: Is it a saloon, bar, pub, or canteen? be (mostly) consistent.
* [ ] there may be TOO much up and down from the control room. Maybe consider ditching the control room in the sail and put it in the same room as navigation and sonar.
* [ ] Consider removing parts where Percy second-guesses herself.
	* Hard to say: on the one hand it contributes the tension by having her doubt the outcome of her decisions
	* On the other, you could have Hemi do the questioning (gently) and have Percy be insistent that she's right.
		* Might make for more interesting dialog
		* and Percy is NOT always right, just most of the time.
* [X] Sort out the accent for Chips
	* like feckin instead of fuckin
	* make it more lady-like: imagine an Irish farmer's wife with a foul tongue.
	* Maybe it's just something simple and non-specific, using compounds, or dropped h's or something
	* maybe it's too star treky cliche to have an engineer with an accent?
	* The name Chips doesn't feel like it's working
* [X] Maybe Hemi is the one character who doesn't (normally/ever) curse?
	* Chips: curses all the time
	* Shakes: a lot
	* Percy: When she's pissed
	* Hemi: never
* [ ] Add? "They were only 100 meters under water, some people could kick a ball that distance"
* [ ] Add? "The way sound travels underwater is complex, sometimes almost magical."
* [ ] Go back and hit the symbolism of the boat landed on the mountaintop a little harder.
* [ ] make sure the 'Said [someone]s' are only where you absolutely need them for clarity of who is talking.
* [ ] fix creeping towards the seamount:
	* I think creeping allows the batteries to last long, but if you're going for distance, you can probably go at speed.
* [X] Does Shakes smoke tons of pot? Is there a brick of weed on the Gnat?
	* Or cocaine? 
	* coca leaves? (He did come from a coffee farm)
	* also coca leaves give the suggestion of global commerce exchange
* [ ] Would they waste electricity on cooking if they were very low on power?
* [ ] make sure welding refers to 'rigs' not 'tanks'
	* arc welding is used for underwater welding
	* which means that like the stove, they have to be careful about fuel/power consumption
	* the welding rig needs to run a generator or from boat power, I think
* [ ] Is it a 'mating collar' or a 'docking collar'?
* [ ] when they call Hemi Hem' for short, make sure it has an apostrophe
* [ ] Fix that the Gnat's docking collar should be _inside_ the Prospect's --- so it can be welded by Chips when it leaks. Also, seems more likely, like fitting a lego piece together or something.
* [X] Is the moon pool thing where they mate with the Gnat right? Wouldn't it be two atmospheres at the bottom of the Prospect (roughly 30 feet down), and already ruining the moon pool effect, at least without increasing the pressure in the Prospect? Or does the Prospect run slightly pressurized in general as a safety measure?
	* No, it would flood at 2 atmospheres (bottom of the boat) see: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-air-pressure-in-a-submarine
* [ ] find and remove 'inches' and 'feet' references
* [X] Black sub should probably be referred to as the sub with the ram. (virtually all subs are black, cept the ones that are gray)
* [ ] Consider having Owen and Percy get into a conflict, Owen wants to make one move with the Prospect and Percy is determined to do something else. Owen turns out to be right. Percy doesn't apologize
	* ...could also be Bastian for a little character development, but I think he remains just a skinny quiet smoking pole.
	* I like that this will play in later when they decide what to do if they find out that Owen slept with the black sub's captain's wife.
	* though maybe this human relations element is covered by the fight with Chips
* [ ] review specs for Gnat in notes --- do you want to be clear it has a deck gun? Pigeon access hole?
	* Maybe the deck gun is inside the Gnat, Shakes can mount it if he needs to.
	* make sure these are picked up in the diagram, where appropriate
* General style stuff to address throughout:
	* [ ] Do you need to do more to pump up the human relations in the story?
		* Imagine that a resolution with Chips leads to something successfully happening at the end of the story
		* Or more generally, Percy's has a stubborn insistence throughout the book that she's right, and it leads to some conflict that needs resolution.
		* On the other hand, I don't like the idea that human actions/emotions are rational, follow a path, or are even knowable; or that conflict can be resolved with a motivating speech or resolution between two characters. Beyond just seeming cliche, life never works like that.
		* How then to assure the human interest, and at the same time avoid a cliche character conflict arc?
			* Think about how things play out on Deadliest Catch. Sometimes the motivational speech works... often it doesn't.
	* [ ] keep an eye out for military terms --- avoid
		* [ ] like generally, you want to remove the word 'orders'
	* [ ] You need to _see_ the aesthetic of the grime in your head if you want to describe it; the same way you see the mechanical bits.
	* [ ] watch the pacing, it's a little off in places:
		* [ ] it should be a slow build up to a big singular event like the ballast blow
		* [ ] And it should be a draw-out grind in a staring-at-dials scene that goes hauls the tension along relentlessly
		* [ ] fill in the time-passing sections with something to pull the pacing along at a slow but steady rate, 
			* don't just montage over them, it makes it feel like things are moving too fast.
	* [ ] make sure the _fear_ is in there, particularly in the build up to big inflection points
	* [ ] It isn't capturing the grittiness enough, build that up
	* [ ] try putting in more cursing. Maybe it seems like it's hard to do it genuinely. but on the other hand, maybe all you have to do is _do_ it --- curses every third word.
		* I think TV has programmed you to think you can't use cursing so much. But even TV that doesn't shy away from cursing still has far less cursing than even average real life. (except Deadwood of course)
		* And a lot more cursing might actually be a simple way to make it grittier.
		* Also they're a bunch of fuckin sailors!
		* Maybe the only time they don't curse is when someone is _truly_ angry? (Or is it better to go like Steve on Deadwood at his angriest?)
			* Like the note you read about 'fuck' during WWII: the only time it wasn't used was when something serious was happing: "Grab your [no-fucking] guns."
	* [ ] Consider pulling back or deleting the metaphors
	* [ ] Keep in mind that in this world, like the opening set piece, nature is deliberately cruel and evil, tormenting
		* So at some point, it should be _pulling_ them to the depths
		* akin to the cruelty and evil of power --- the Authorities; but where the Authority cruelty is random, nature's cruelty is deliberate
		* The only way they survive in nature's cruelty is through their grimey machine, the submarine
* [ ] consider using 'nautical' to mean awesome 
	* (dark-awesome, like original meaning maybe)
* [ ] consider using 'nominal' to mean anything you want it to.
* [ ] consider adding a conversation about tools and how a character prefers hand tools whenever they can get them.
* [ ] Need to add a clearer description of Hemi earlier in the book.
* [ ] Need to include a description of Percy somwhere early in the book
	* (There's the line about the leather pants she's wearing when she's kneeling on the grates; this might need to be moved up into or reflected in description of her)
	* [ ] Subtly reinforce Percy's beauty in more places:
		* Right now I think she reads more like the elder captain she will be in later stories
		* Other characters should sometimes react to her youth and beauty --- but she has no interest in that herself.
		* The older version of her (see character notes) was really for being a role model for Shakes. That isn't in this first book. Maybe later.

## Story elements specific to this story
:elements:
* [X] overall theme: being chased by a dark force of evil (black sub) from place to place to place
* [X] plot milestones
	* on a dead calm sea
	* rammed and sunk on the top of a seamount (like Moses on Ararat) 
	* a depot (for repairs and pick up cargo)
	* on the surface in a storm (wave porn -- the sub sneaks up on them because they can't hear them over the crashers)
	* hiding in the depths, escape under the deep scattering layer
	* Into an exotic remote city with junks everywhere; homes built on stilts; the metal machine tooling through rickety wood structures; unload cargo at port
	* bicycle race in the hangar
	* into the pacific garbage patch; the final battle
* [X] bottomed on a seamount
	* A 'guyot' or tablemount
	* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guyot
* [X] They visit depots that have staging areas above ground on the coast, and underwater sub connections for loading and unloading goods.
* [X] they do deadliest catch style shifts of more than 24 hours with everyone exhausted (mine from that 33 minute episode of battlestar gallactica)
	* no sleep
	* lots of crew doing cocaine or unnamed but clearly doing stimulants
	* bloodshot eyes, mistakes from tiredness
	* the captain struggles to get the crew into the rack reasonably often
* [X] in a desperate underwater chase, they have to run the big sub off the mini sub's batteries, by stringing essentially huge jumper cables through the ship and up into the mated mini sub
* [X] An authority sub or ship is equipped with a battering ram
* [X] deep scattering layer move:
	* {They head down towards the deep scattering layer --- the instruments telling them they are going to hit the bottom, hard. But Percy knows instinctively that it's just billions of tiny fish --- the "bottom" has a particular sound on sonar.}
	* {They pass through the deep scattering layer, and get away from the enemy who thinks they disappeared on the bottom... though not hearing them crash would need to be resolved somehow --- maybe this is how you can work the Gnat back into it? Percy has the Gnat buzz past to overwhelm their ears just when the pass through the deep scattering layer?}
	* ~~On Authority sub: "I see nothing but the bottom on the scope" "that's not the bottom, that's the deep scattering layer. they are hiding under it."~~
* [X] Deck boss/nerd character figures out to use magnetic mines and some kind of float to put the mines in the path of the chasing authority sub. 
	* the nerd character calculates by hand how much psi to put in the float so the mine sits at the depth of the chasing sub. they fill the floats by hand and launch them out the airlock into the path of the chasing sub.
* [X] the nerd character might be able to listen to the water mics and determine size and types of ships by screw rpms or something?
* [X] The mini sub in some situation wants to create even more noise, so they make some kind of adjustment to the engines to run clackily or something.
* [X] at some point have one of the characters dip a comb in engine grease and run it through their hair
* [X] they have a pile of crappy old (pre-war) bicycles, when the cargo bay is clear, they have donut races like the Seven xmas party:
* [X] someone says sub-marine like it's two words. maybe a trader in a depot or something.
	* (because submarine is such a strange mush of a word to say) 
* [ ] A conversation about why salmon cans are shaped with an angle:
	* Because the can rolls in a circle on the floor!
		* Shakes is the one who suggests this
		* "I wish I could all cans like this. I hate it when a can falls over in the Gnat and rolls forward where I can't get it."
	* No, cuz they can stack more cans in the hold of a ship
* [ ] Maybe in some battle situation, they can use 3D thinking to outwit some smart enemy who is limited to 2D thinking. (ala kahn in star trek 2)
* [ ] long slow chase scene akin to O'Brian books. they run until the batteries run out and they have to surface. on the surface they are saved from being seen by a fog bank (so they are just as, if not more, blind above water as below)
	* It would be nice to make this the _first_ story because it has all the elements of The Enemy Below. It's archetypal for a submarine story, and at the same time can introduce all styles and characters you want to use. 

## style
:style:
* remember to include a lot of spatial description: the reader should be able to SEE the sub/spaces in their head. 
	* build a map in their head for them.
	* See notes on memory house in writing
* Just make the first submarine novel GO:
	* Go for character-driven (fear) excitement through staring at dials
	* This first book should be the pop novel: readable, accessible, character-driven
		* an accessible novel is more likely to be something you could sell/build a fanbase
	* maybe keep the style experiments for reference when you later go back to write filthy scum
		* and the submarine novel is just accessible and readable, with occasional elements of that style?
		* a more stylized one is more likely to push you in a more award-winning type direction, but that can come later
	* do both?!
	* Go for descriptive renderings of sounds, and on the rare occasions it merits it, sights
	* I'm not sure the sub novel can be all the things you want it to be
	* also, different sub books/stories/chapters could have different styles as you go
	* better to produce than to get stuck trying to get the perfect style
	* accessibility is more important than style:
		* do NOT fall into the trap of keeping things abstract for the sake of style. those books are often (and often rightfully) unpopular.
		* on the other hand layering style on top of accessibility is the dream: like Batman
* maybe with the engine running full blast, it SOUNDS heavy and grimey, like dopesmoker.
	* try to think about what a listener to dopesmoker would want to read. 
* think carefully about where you "dive" into description:
	* character's clothing, for example, should just be mentioned in casual passing: "she placed the pencil into the front pocket of her cracking leather overalls."
	* but you might want to go all-in with description when they are staring at dials under pressure.
* remember to focus on _description_ of the grime, darkness, cold, hardness. Make it feel like Deadwood or Blood Meridian, though with good story. Do NOT make it feel like a sci-fi or naval/military story.
* consider NOT having any exterior shots. 
	* it may help the sense of isolation and being in a can if all action takes place _inside_ (the depot, the _Prospect_, the _Gnat_) 
	* having considered this, where I do have exterior shots so far I really like them. I'm not getting rid of them.
	* Though perhaps they end up being the exception that proves the rule.
* Even though it would have been cool to have people communicating on the boat through tubes, that's really a 19th century thing, and I think for where these boats are at, historically, it would just have to be intercoms.

## On writing this book
:onwriting:
* (See notes about technology vs magic elsewhere)
* Writing this novel, alone in a 600sf 3-room apartment in January. It's too cold to go outside, and the outside is contaminated by disease. The apartment is a 100 year old building with steam heat: water and air pushing and banging through rusty pipes, the power-flush of the toilet that you can hear even from other apartments... this place FEELS like a submarine.
	* At one point, writing about starting up diesel engines, I smell diesel exhaust in my apartment, as if I conjured it. though presumably it was from some truck idling outside.
* I am constrained so much more than you could ever know or articulate by the conventions of what is considered "good" writing:
	* the instinct to go off in a wild new direction; the desire to scrape up a hard-pushed metaphor; but more than anything else the constant pressure for things to make _sense_ --- characters motivated rationally, story order, character style
	* All of these things I find myself constantly checking and cutting back for fear of some judgmental reader telling me to 'kill my babies' and that it's too purple, too pushed, too random.
	# * I wish I could just say fuck those people. But SOME of that does actually improve the quality of the writing. My fear is that it makes it dull in equal parts. What about art requiring fanatacism? I should more often be fanatically telling that theoretical reader to go fuck themselves.
* I feel like the Calvin and Hobbes where they make the yard conform to the map instead of the other way around.
	* I feel like I'm making the story conform to the map (and the rules of submarine technology). Sometimes I wonder if it should be the other way around.
	* Or maybe this is just how a good story gets written.

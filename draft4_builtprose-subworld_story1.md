# Built out prose (draft 4) of subworld story 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



### Opening scene --- night on a black dead calm sea

The weight of the atmosphere pressed the still night air down on the surface of the ocean. The water compressed under the weight, flattened and stilled, unable to raise enough energy to give more than an occasional barely perceptible heave to the glassy smoothness. A dome of heavy dark clouds above held the weight down and pressed, like a schoolyard miscreant torturing some stick-legged runt. The clouds were dimly lit to the color of the charred edges of a coal by a distant and feeble moon, not visible and kept out, on the other side of the impenetrable dome of cloud. That moon rested up there untormented by the pressure of the atmosphere, but unable to muster enough warmth to do anything about it. It merely had to stand by and watch as the cupped clouds compressed the surface. It was all it could do to provide even the coldest dimmest light. The light that filtered down through layer upon layer of gray cloud was so diluted and refracted that it left the sky only a few shades lighter than the water. 

The ocean was black. While above the atmosphere rode heavenly bodies that radiated light and heat, and the thick gasses of the atmosphere carried some portion of that warmth down to the surface, below the water was darkness and cold, and the viscous liquid sent that darkness up to the surface. The darkness yielded not at all to the pressure of the atmosphere above.

On this unvarying plain of black a point appeared. A miniscule and meaningless point, like the first push of a needle through the underside of a new piece of fabric, the workings of which would soon join the fabric irrevocably and forever to another with hundreds of interwoven taught stitches, pulled tight by binding thread. The point rose, a long thin wire sting extruded up, piercing through the surface. A thin V-shaped wake trailed behind it in the water marking its course. The wire bent back against the pressure of the air, as it grew up from the surface, it bent over more until it's tip was nearly horizontal to the surface of the water, held there in a long gracefully arcing line.

At its base the wire rested on a short steel mast which broke through the surface a moment later, accompanied by a series of a half dozen other masts, each leaving a more significant wake behind it. The low string of wakes carved up the black surface behind the path of the masts with their nested Vs.

A flat black oblong pushed through the surface and rose up into the air. Water streamed across the flat top and down the smooth metal sides of the oblong. It became a curved vertical wall, in the same manner seismic forces raised up a new continent, and thrust up against the pressure of the atmosphere. Water shot out of vents in the side of the walls, draining out interior spaces that had been filled when it was submerged. The oblong was pushed up by the giant body it sprouted from. An enormous flat deck broke in a long line far before and abaft of the oblong. The sea water washed over and off the deck, running down the curved sides that now revealed themselves supporting the deck from below. The surface gave before the unrelenting push of this monster, and a wake of dull gray broke on the smooth black surface behind it.

At first it moved with total silence, other than the sound of the water pushing and running along it's sides and the soft crash of the curling water it left behind it. Then it coughed, spit, and from two pipes that opened at the top of it's oblong dorsal fin two arcs of flame burst orange into the surrounding blackness, spraying apocalyptic color across the landscape of pitch. The flames flashed over the blackness and reflected off the low clouds, and then died back into the pipes from which they came, leaving behind the rolling churn of exploding diesel and hot air pouring up through the pipes and forcing the shutters that normally protected them from the influx of water to remain open.

The engines of the machine revved up, and then maintained a loud high pitch, generating energy to drive it forward with contained combustion followed by blowing heat. The surfaced ship maintained an unvarying speed.

There was a recessed well set into the top of the dorsal fin. At the bottom of this shallow well, there was the creak of a rusty wheel turning, and a crescent moon of red light split the black bottom of the well and widened into a perfect circle as a hatch lifted open. The shadow of a figure climbed through it and stood upright on the deck followed by another much larger shadow. Both figures looked around at the darkness, lit only by the red glow at their feet. They leaned forward and rested against the fairing. The smaller figure made a few extra gestures in the darkness, and then a match light glowed against the end of a stubby cigarillo.

Captain Percy gestured with the glowing coal of the cigarillo out at the darkness. The figure next to her, dwarfing her in size, just nodded. There was no need to describe the all-consuming blackness aloud.

"Fucking perfect night for a surface run." Said the giant figure.

"Perfect night to contemplate your own fucking doom, Hemi." Said Captain Percy.

"It seems that in our business, we're always safest when our doom is closest by. Wear your doom like a blanket, Captain."

"A blanket keeps you warm, our doom is unlikely to be very warm. It's probably best if you keep your fucking imaginative comparisons to fucking yourself Hemi."

"Perhaps so." Hemi paused, there was no reason to rush anything this night. "The usual plan for tonight then?"

"Same as every other fucking night Hemi. Charge up the batteries, run on the surface to the light cracks the sky. Make sure your keep those fucking insolent pissants at the controls awake."

Hemi put one huge hand on her shoulder and turned to climb down through the hatch. Captain Percy pulled on her cigarillo and the coal at the tip glowed in the darkness. Her doom would eventually probably be a doom of freezing, she knew that, but at least tonight it was warm enough to be up on the top of her ship. The blackness lay on it, and she did indeed find it comforting that in the blackness, nobody could see them. If she controlled all the levers of the universe, her boat would never be seen.


### They get rammed by a black sub

Captain Percy stayed on the bridge of the sail for hours, smoking her way through one cigarillo after another, her thoughts spiraling out into the darkness. For a long time it was a study in sensory deprivation. The diesel engines were loud enough but unvarying. So too, the vibration from them that came up through the steel-grate deck and shook her boots never changed in frequency or amplitude. The blackness around her seemed never-ending, though the boat pushed relentlessly forward. It occurred to Captain Percy that when her boat, the _Prospect_ was submerged, this is what it must be like outside --- silent and black. It felt like she had loosed the bonds of her corporal body and had floated outside it, so she could experience what her boat was like when it was pushing through the icy blackness of an alien world where the pressure would collapse a corporal body into a mush of hemoglobin and fats.

As with many things that seem interminable, the slow but persistent forward motion eventually forced the dome of clouds to relent, and they crawled out under a sky of stars and a weak, low moon. Captain Percy could see her hand holding her cigarillo now and the long shadow of the _Prospect_ stretching out before her, parting the waters to allow her to pass as she rode astride this beast of hers.

Captain Percy knew her boat well. She had spent enough time with it to have internalized its movements. She almost always knew what the boat was doing just by the feeling of it --- the angle of the deck, the vibrations of the engines or motors, even at depth, when the struts and structures of the boat groaned under the weight of the water above, the sounds of the boat under pressure felt like the normal sounds of a huge human taking a great weight on its shoulders. The only time she ever worried was when the _Prospect_ conveyed sounds, or motions, or input to her that she couldn't recognize. It was now a collection of haptic feedback to her senses that made her feel a rise of panic in her chest. The boat shuddered, as if the cold water it had swam through all these years had finally gotten a reaction from it. And then Captain Percy was thrown violently against the fairing.

She immediately got down to the deck of the bridge. She stuck her head over the hatch hole and looked down to Hemi's large face looking up at her from a couple of decks below.

"I don't know!" He yelled up to her before she could ask. She could hear him giving orders to shut down the diesel engines and reverse the propellers.

The bow of the _Prospect_ had come to a dead stop, but the stern still had forward motion. Captain Percy could feel the whole boat turning unnaturally around its center axis, like the experiment of a child --- a magnetized pin through a cork floating in a bowl of water, pulled around by the invisible forces of planetary alignment.

The deck under her started to lean to the starboard side. Captain Percy braced one foot against the inside of the bridge well wall. The boat listed sickeningly. Captain Percy got to her feet, still braced against the angle of the boat. She gripped the fairing, peering out over the edge into the night, scanning for a cause. The water was still black and calm, though not quite glassy as it had been earlier in the night. They were far from shore, in fairly well-charted though relatively little-trafficked waters. These should have been safe waters, with nothing to hit.

For a few moments the boat hung at an angle, and then began to right itself. As the fairing came lower, Captain Percy could see more of the sea off to port, and there now rose there the black curve of another submarine. It poked its bow out of the water first, with a modified and reinforced jagged point, a medieval looking device intended for ramming ships. The bow was followed by the long black swelling curve of a military submarine, that rose from the surface with water smoothly flowing off its sides. The sail came up with dive planes on its side, set at an angle to raise the boat quickly. When the stern finally came up to the surface, it was mere meters away, its swirling wake washing white up the against the side of the _Prospect_. 

"...Like Satan dropped a fucking shit on us." Captain Percy said to herself as she climbed down through the hatch and the red crescent of light waned out of existence behind her.


### They crash dive

Captain Percy stood on the metal rungs of the ladder just under the topside hatch, and with one hand screwed shut the squeaking wheel of the hatch seal. She grasped the sides of the ladder and bypassing the rungs slid down into the cramped control room. Hemi looked at her through his small-framed spectacles.

"Down." She gave the one-word order as she pushed the button on the wall that activated the dive alarm. 

"Give me full speed forward." Said Hemi as he put one large hand on each of the shoulders of the two men who sat at the controls of the sub and gave them orders to dive the boat. One of these men was a stick-figure of a man who went by moniker Bastian. The other, Gregory had a meaty square forehead that echoed his meaty square body. Of the two of them, only Gregory looked like he belonged on a submarine.

Diving the sub required delicacy under the calmest circumstances. Now Hemi and the two men at the controls carefully timed their movements, their eyes scanning continually over the wall of dials and gauges in front of them, reflected in the red glow of the night lighting. Gregory and Bastian made adjustments according to Hemi's instructions by opening and closing various of the dozens of valves in front of them, or flipping on or off switches. The submarine let out a long exhale of breath, the air that had held it aloft being pressed out by an onrush of water into the flooding tanks.

"Flood the express dive tank." Ordered Hemi. Bastian reached up and opened a valve and water thrust through thick pipes deep into the deepest parts of the bow of the boat. The bow pitched steeply downwards and Captain Percy reached to grab old leather loops that hung overhead. She angled her feet against the incline and watched the depth gauge. 

The ship-to-ship radio above Captain Percy's head lit up, and over the speaker a recorded voice broadcast a warning that they were violating the territorial waters of someone they had never heard of, authorized by a series of treaties with titles that became acronyms that became words that contributed to further acronyms. The recording ordered them to surface and prepare to be boarded. Hemi punched the mute button on the radio.

"Territories and treaties are for the surface." Said Hemi. Captain Percy nodded.

But she was pissed. "This wouldn't have happened if we had someone listening to the sonar mics while we were running on the surface."

"We wouldn't have heard them coming over the diesels." Replied Hemi.

"We would have fucking known they were there soon enough to take some evasive action at least!"

"Later! We have to deal with being understaffed later. First let's get out from under this asshole."

There was barely enough space in the control room for 4 people. They were all breathing each other's air. Hemi took a rag from a hook and wiped condensation from the glass faces of the dials and gauges, and then wiped the nervous sweat from his hands with the rag. 

"100 meters." Said Gregory.

"OK. Level us off." Said Hemi. Gregory and Bastian spun closed some of the trim tank valves and rolled the dive planes level. The angle of the boat slowly eased upwards. Captain Percy pulled out another cigarillo and lit it. She nervously sucked at it, and then ashed it into a tin cup that smelled of her stale coffee from three hours earlier.


### They realize there's something wrong

"Something isn't right." Said Captain Percy. Just like before when she was on the bridge, she knew something was wrong with her boat. There was no single instrument that reported anything amiss. But then no single instrument on a submarine described the whole being of the boat. They had to be taken together, internalized, and combined with what you felt the boat doing. She had to hold the depth in her head, while taking in the dive plane angle, and the speed. Normally this happened instinctively, she processed it all automatically, and she could just _feel_ what her boat was doing from a quick glance at this wall of dials combined with what her senses told her about the angle of the boat and dead reckoning from the accelerations she had experienced.

But it wasn't working right now. Her eyes scanned back and forth across the dials, but they didn't come together, she couldn't make sense of them, and could not figure out what was happening to her boat. In this steel tube with no windows, for the first time ever, she was truly blind.

"Hemi... what's going on...?"

"Fuck me if I know..." He reached past Gregory and turned the rudder. The boat came along, slowly. "Sluggish?"


### Captain Percy goes looking for what's wrong

"I need to go look her over. Let me know on the PA if something happens." Hemi nodded and Captain Percy slipped down the ladder to the deck below. She passed forward through navigation and sonar and down a steep flight of steel stairs and through the crew quarters where their third deck crew member, Owen, was snoring in his rack behind one of the moth-eaten old bed curtains since he was off watch. At the back of crew quarters, she went down another rusting steel ladder through a hatch to the lowest of the three main decks. If there were something wrong with her boat, this is the deck where it would be.

She flipped on the lights. There was no red night lighting rigged down here, it was just bare white bulbs in a string behind cages to keep them from being broken. In this part of the boat, the entire lower deck was full of batteries, strung together with rat's nest of black cables as thick as her finger. The batteries were bolted with steel straps to row upon row of steel shelves. The straps were rusting away and the cables were grouped together with wire ties and slung along the racks in heavy bundles. The floor was steel grating. She got to her knees, the steel grating pushing through her cracked brown leather pants. She put her fingers through the grating and lifted it up and put it aside. She reached her hand down and felt the raw steel hull of the pressure hull. It was cold, damp, and greasy, but that was normal. She replaced the grate and went on to the next compartment forward.

More batteries here, though fewer. They lined the walls, but not very deeply because there were trim tanks inside the pressure hull in this compartment. She checked below the grating again, but here too everything was normal. She passed forward from that compartment into the main cargo bay.

The main cargo bay was one giant compartment, more than thirty meters long and almost ten meters wide. The air was still and stale and smelled of rust. The lights were a harsh jaundiced yellow color. The hold was mostly empty --- they had been coming from their last dropoff and were heading towards the depots in the north in hopes of being hired for another shipment. A few molding wooden crates were stacked up along the sides, and a pile of rusted bicycles were stacked up and strapped down with leather straps to keep them from shifting in one corner. She walked along the center of it, listening carefully. It seemed to her there was something wrong with the sound of her footsteps on the metal grating. As she got toward the front of the compartment, she realized it wasn't her footsteps, it was that she could hear water trickling. She knelt down and pulled up the grating. There was a lake of oily black water just under the grating. The ramming had cracked the pressure hull, and the _Prospect's_ cargo bay was filling slowly with water.


### Hemi deals with the pursuing sub in the control room

"Keep this depth, and course, I'll be down in sonar listening for our friend." Hemi climbed down to the compartment below. From the sonar station he could still give orders to the control room, and hear reports from Gregory and Bastian. He remained standing at the sonar station, and slipped the old headphones onto his head, covering one ear and leaving the other free.

He spun the control wheel for the sonar around slowly, listening for human sounds out there in the darkness. It was dead silent.

"Hemi," Gregory called down through the hatch, "I'm having trouble keeping the boat level. I find I keep having to give it more dive plane angle just to keep from sinking."

"Let me come up and play with the trim tanks." Said Hemi, climbing back up to the control room. He stood at the trim tank controls and his thick fingers spun one small steel wheel, then the next. Each was accompanied by water pushing through pipes, flowing from one end of the boat to the other. "How's that?" Asked Hemi.

"Better, but still more plane angle that I would expect." Said Gregory.

Hemi didn't say out loud what he was thinking: they were sinking.


### Captain Percy goes to recruit Chips to help fix the leak

"Sweet fucking hell." She said to herself. "Sweet fucking hell!" She yelled. She ran up the cargo bay, and back into the battery compartments. She pulled the heavy watertight bulkhead closed behind her, and turned the wheel to seal it. It took all her strength, these seal were rarely used and steadily rusting themselves into stasis.

She climbed up a deck, and went back into the engine room, where the only sound was the quiet hum of the electric motors running in the next compartment back, and a clanking of tools from the deck below. She leaned over the open hatch to the lower engine room.

"Chips! Chips, come over here."

The clanking sound stopped and the face of the _Prospect's_ engineer peer up at her. Chips wore leather overalls stained with grease, and had her hair tied back in a thick black braid. Her hands were black with grease and were holding the body of a small deconstructed piece of machinery, as if she had been butchering some small game animal for dinner.

"Fuck's up?"

"There's a leak." These were words no submariner ever wanted to hear. But Chips had fixed leaks before. It was the answer to the next question that Captain Percy didn't want to have to give.

"Yar. Where's it?"

"...In the cargo bay."

"And's bad, ah?"

"Pretty fucking bad."

"So we're fuckin fucked then, ah? Fuckin fucked, cuz the cargo bay's too big, and the boat won't fuckin float if's flooded. ah Capt' Percy? Fuckin fucked!" She threw her piece of machinery at the wall where it clanged and sent small part flying into far dirty corners of the lower engine room.

"For fuck's sake Chips, yes we're fucked, but we're not _fuckin'_ fucked yet... I need you to take one of the guys, go in there, and see if you can stop it at patch it so we don't get to the point where we _are_ fuckin' fucked. Move!"

"Ah, fuck ya Capt." Chips started climbing up the ladder.

"Good or bad, I want regular reports Chips. Get Owen up and get him helping you."

"ah fuckin kay."

A loud ringing ping echoed through the steel hull of the boat. It hit them broadside, and passed through them. It rang off the opposite side of the hull and echoed back through the air to their ears. 

"Ah, and someone's fuckin' hunting us too!" Cursed Chips.

"Go!" Said Captain Percy. She left Chips digging out patch kits and her welding rig and went back up to the control room.

Hemi looked at her. "I guess they have no reason to fear giving away their position to us with an active sonar ping, since we have nothing to shoot at them." 

"Someday, Hemi, I'll make the _Prospect_ the first merchant sub with a torpedo tube just for you. Til then, we're just a small prey animal and our defense is to run and hide."

"There's no hiding for us right now. If you're back in the control room for the moment, I'll go down to sonar to keep tabs on them. How's the boat, by the way?"

"We're sinking. I put Chips on it." 

"Well, if she can patch the boat with expletives and downright pissed-offedness, we're in good shape then."


### Percy looks at the situation in the conn

"What's the state of my ship boys?" Captain Percy asked Gregory and Bastian.

"Apparently we're fucking sinking." Answered Gregory. 

"Apparently..." She agreed. She scanned the dials. There was nothing immediate in their impending doom. It was written instead in subtle ways across the dials, and when taken together. The dive plane angle was too steep for the amount of forward drive they were giving the boat. The trim tanks too light, the depth deeper than she wanted to be.

"Since they know where we are anyway, you might as well crank the bilge pumps up to maximum power. Better to make a bunch of noise than to sink."

Gregory flipped some switches and another frequency of vibration was added to the regular background hum from the motors propelling the boat.

"How's she handling generally?" Captain Percy asked.

"The boat just doesn't seem normal. It doesn't respond the way I want it to." Said Bastian.

"Here, let me try the rudder." Captain Percy turned the rudder wheel hard over. The _Prospect_ came about slowly but surely, she leaned over slightly, as she should, but then the whole boat leaned more sharply. Percy counter-steered and brought her back to the course they had been on.

"See? That doesn't seem quite OK to me." Said Bastian.

Captain Percy knew it was more than not OK. The delay before the sharp lean was the weight of the slack water in the bilge pouring over to one side of the boat and forcing her to lean.


### Percy goes to check on Chips' progress

"I... need to go check on Chips." She slid back down the ladder, patted Hemi on the back as she walked past him, and down the forward stairs to the cargo hold. Chips and Owen were at the far end, with bright work lamps rigged up. Owen was running a fat filthy hose for an old mobile bilge pump from the lake up the length of the cargo bay intending to connect it up to one of the trim tanks. Chips had a whole set of the grates out and stacked up. She was wearing thick rubber waders and standing directly on the inside of the pressure hull in the slick black water. The water had reached above the grating level and was almost to Chips chest, though she was not a very tall woman. She had heavy rubber welding gloves on, and a mask so she could see what she was doing under the water. When she lifted her head up for air, water ran down her mask in rivulets, and drained in a greasy gray stream from her thick braid of hair.

Captain Percy stood on the grating above her watching her latest attempt at welding shut the leak under the water. When she raised her head again Captain Percy asked her to report.

"Ah fuck ya, ya goddamn dominating twat. This is delicate work here, and it needs time. It's a'hundreds of tiny cracks, the hull splitted open the way ya might break off a piece of cheese --- with tiny cracks. If'n were one big crack t'would be much simpler."

Captain Percy spat, and her spit tasted oily and gritty to her, like the bilge water filling her boat. "Keep trying. I'm going to blow the tanks and bring us up though."

"Ah, fuckin smartest thing ya said yet this day, ya fucker. This course we're pursuin' right now is'na trackway to the gates 'a hell."


### Percy blows the tanks

Captain Percy headed back up the stairs to the control room. As she passed Hemi at the sonar she told him she was blowing the tanks. He nodded. "What about the sub following us?" He asked.

"We've crossed that line of risk, we're better off with them than down here now." She replied.

In the control room, she knelt down and opening a long thin toolbox bolted to the wall near the floor. From it she took a wrench as long as forearm, wrapped in a thick grease-stained rag. She fitted the end of it over a nut that was set in a fat pipe running along the wall.

"OK guys, I'm blowing the tanks." She warned the control room, and then turned the wrench until it was horizontal, aligned with the old pipe. Then she did it again with the sister pipe running just above it. A loud rush of moving air, under immense pressure, hissed through the pipe. All through the ship the sound of air pressing water out of the ship, changing the very mass of the ship itself.

"Take us up guys. Set the dive planes, and blow any trim tanks you haven't yet." Percy said to Gregory and Bastian. They turned the control wheels, the bow the of boat rose slowly, gently. Captain Percy looked across the dials. Once again they weren't reading what they should. Once again, something was wrong. "We're not going up fast enough..."

"We're not going up at all." Said Bastian. "Fuck me."

Percy went over each instrument, and the setting of each wheel in her head. "Hemi! She called down to him. "Hemi! We're not rising! The forward ballast didn't blow! They must have crushed the high pressure pipes when they rammed us."

Hemi looked up at her through his small glasses frames, his face only a few inches from the hatch opening because he was so large. "Captain Percy," he said, "I think we need to start thinking about more drastic measures to get us back on the surface."


### Percy blows the fuel ballast

"The fuel ballast?"

"Yes, I think we should dump the diesel at this point. Even if we get to the surface, we could lose the boat if the cargo bay keeps flooding and we can't figure out how to empty it. That's a bigger risk than not having enough fuel to get to port if we can manage to stay on the surface."

Captain Percy considered. But sometimes considerations are meaningless. They had passed the point of strategizing on how to evade their pursuers. For a submarine captain, the situation she now faced was the single biggest nightmare: get to the surface at any cost. Knowing that, the decision to blow out the fuel ballast tanks --- to dump all their diesel in the ocean --- was not even one that had to be made.

There were in fact two long thin toolboxes bolted to the wall. One had the tank blow wrench. The other was padlocked and contained the fuel ballast blow wrench. Captain Percy was the only person who carried the key to this second toolbox. She unlocked it and withdrew another wrapped wrench the same length as the tank blow wrench. But this one had a special 5-sided socket that would only fit the nut to open the air line into the fuel ballast tanks. As before, she fitted the wrench onto one air pipe, then the second, and another rush of high pressure air pushed through the ship. And their precious diesel fuel --- the only way to shore, was pushed out into the deep waters of the ocean.

"Now... now are we fucking rising?" Percy asked after a few minutes. But she was looking at the same gauges as everyone else. She could read them as well as anyone else.

Gregory was tentative. "We're... holding steady."

Owen, the youngest of the crew stuck his head up through the hatch while he stood on the ladder up to the control room. "Captain, Chips wants me to tell you that the cracks are splitting wider, and the flooding in the cargo bay is getting worse."

"Sweet fuck." Said Gregory.

"Can't we surface Captain?" Owen asked.

"Go back and help Chips. Do anything she asks of you."

"Alrighty." And Owen's head disappeared back from whence it came.


### Percy decides to head for the bottom

Percy was running out of ideas. It was easy when the only decision was to get to the surface at all costs while there still remained some levers to pull and options to engage. But now nothing remained that she could think of that would push them back towards the surface. She cleared her mind. The surface seemed so far away. The surface wasn't her natural environment anyway. Up there was war, borderlines, treaties, enforcers and authorities. Up there was conflict, nations, and bureaucracy. Underwater was where she belonged, where they were free to go where they liked, when they liked, by virtue of the exponentially huge amount of room provided by being able to move along the Z axis. Still, she had no desire to die down here. And no matter how safe and free underwater felt, there was always that yawning gulf under them, a black, cold, bottomless hell. Once you go _too_ far down, you go down forever. She wanted to be free, but she didn't want that.

She put the idea of the surface out of her mind. What if they did go down instead of up? What if they could find safety and respite in the deep?

She slipped down to the navigation and sonar compartment, where Hemi was still listening on the sonar headset. "Hemi, how deep is it here?"

"1000 meters, give or take. Essentially bottomless."

"Hmm." She went to the charts. The navigation station sat on top of a stack of flat files. Behind rolls of charts that were more commonly used were stacked between upright stakes. When they had the white lights on, the charts showed their age, yellowed and flaking at the edges. Hemi had their current position marked with a grease pencil on a glass sheet laying over the chart showing their position. The black smudges trailed up away from the shore they had left days before. They were in the goddamned middle of the ocean. It was a wasteland, far from any continental shelf or island that they could make it to on battery power alone, while slowly sinking. She pulled down a magnifier that hung from the ceiling by a retractable string. She looked closely at the grease markings on the chart, and the depth markings around them. "Hemi... come here." He put down the headphones, through which he was hearing nothing anyway and came over. She pointed to a spot on the map. "Figure out how to get us here. I'll be trying to eek out every ounce of buoyancy from my boat, and see how long we can last."

Hemi peered through the magnifier, and then pulled his slide rule from his pocket. He made some adjustments, some marks with the grease pencil on the glass, he touched his fingertips with the point of the pencil while muttering some numbers out loud. "I don't know if we can do it. Keep me informed of our exact depth, speed, and most importantly the rate we are sinking at."

Captain Percy smiled. "You keep me informed of the math." And climbed up to the control room.


### They make the run for the tablemount 

In the control room, Captain Percy gave Bastian and Gregory a new heading. "You guys have to do everything you can to keep us up, like gliding an airplane."

"What about our friendly local authority sub pursuing us? Won't they shoot?"

"We're too deep. They won't shoot. With our bilge pumps running flat out they can hear exactly where we are, and know we're in trouble. All they have to do is wait for us to sink or surface."

"How reassuring."

"Hemi!" Captain Percy called down through the hatch. "I want to go as fast as possible. How fast is possible?"

"What's the battery charge?"

"About two-thirds."

"I don't think you should push it beyond 10 knots. At that rate you'll run the batteries down to empty in two hours or so. We're going to need every minute of that two hours.

"Make it 10 knots Bastian." Bastian adjusted the throttle controls until the speed indicated 10 knots.

Percy couldn't wait for Hemi. She started muttering her own equations to herself. "We're already almost 190 meters down. She's rated to 230 --- but that's without cracks in the pressure hull. We need to make it 20 nautical miles. The key question is: how fast are we sinking?"

"We really need to know how fast we're sinking." She said out loud. "Bastian, do you have any sense of it?"

"Well, barring us finding any reserve buoyancy, we're going down a couple of meters every nautical mile or so."

"That might be enough..." Captain Percy whispered to herself.

# Built out prose (draft 4) of subworld story 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



### Opening scene --- night on a black dead calm sea

The weight of the atmosphere pressed the still night air down on the surface of the ocean. The water compressed under the weight, flattened and stilled, unable to raise enough energy to give more than an occasional barely perceptible heave to the glassy smoothness. A dome of heavy dark clouds above held the weight down and pressed, like a schoolyard miscreant torturing some stick-legged runt. The clouds were dimly lit to the color of the charred edges of a coal by a distant and feeble moon, not visible and kept out, on the other side of the impenetrable dome of cloud. That moon rested up there untormented by the pressure of the atmosphere, but unable to muster enough warmth to do anything about it. It merely had to stand by and watch as the cupped clouds compressed the surface. It was all it could do to provide even the coldest dimmest light. The light that filtered down through layer upon layer of gray cloud was so diluted and refracted that it left the sky only a few shades lighter than the water. 

The ocean was black. While above the atmosphere rode heavenly bodies that radiated light and heat, and the thick gasses of the atmosphere carried some portion of that warmth down to the surface, below the water was darkness and cold, and the viscous liquid sent that darkness up to the surface. The darkness yielded not at all to the pressure of the atmosphere above.

On this unvarying plain of black a point appeared. A miniscule and meaningless point, like the first push of a needle through the underside of a new piece of fabric, the workings of which would soon join the fabric irrevocably and forever to another with hundreds of interwoven taught stitches, pulled tight by binding thread. The point rose, a long thin wire sting extruded up, piercing through the surface. A thin V-shaped wake trailed behind it in the water marking its course. The wire bent back against the pressure of the air, as it grew up from the surface, it bent over more until it's tip was nearly horizontal to the surface of the water, held there in a long gracefully arcing line.

At its base the wire rested on a short steel mast which broke through the surface a moment later, accompanied by a series of a half dozen other masts, each leaving a more significant wake behind it. The low string of wakes carved up the black surface behind the path of the masts with their nested Vs.

A flat black oblong pushed through the surface and rose up into the air. Water streamed across the flat top and down the smooth metal sides of the oblong. It became a curved vertical wall, in the same manner seismic forces raised up a new continent, and thrust up against the pressure of the atmosphere. Water shot out of vents in the side of the walls, draining out interior spaces that had been filled when it was submerged. The oblong was pushed up by the giant body it sprouted from. An enormous flat deck broke in a long line far before and abaft of the oblong. The sea water washed over and off the deck, running down the curved sides that now revealed themselves supporting the deck from below. The surface gave before the unrelenting push of this monster, and a wake of dull gray broke on the smooth black surface behind it.

At first it moved with total silence, other than the sound of the water pushing and running along it's sides and the soft crash of the curling water it left behind it. Then it coughed, spit, and from two pipes that opened at the top of it's oblong dorsal fin two arcs of flame burst orange into the surrounding blackness, spraying apocalyptic color across the landscape of pitch. The flames flashed over the blackness and reflected off the low clouds, and then died back into the pipes from which they came, leaving behind the rolling churn of exploding diesel and hot air pouring up through the pipes and forcing the shutters that normally protected them from the influx of water to remain open.

The engines of the machine revved up, and then maintained a loud high pitch, generating energy to drive it forward with contained combustion followed by blowing heat. The surfaced ship maintained an unvarying speed.

There was a recessed well set into the top of the dorsal fin. At the bottom of this shallow well, there was the creak of a rusty wheel turning, and a crescent moon of red light split the black bottom of the well and widened into a perfect circle as a hatch lifted open. The shadow of a figure climbed through it and stood upright on the deck followed by another much larger shadow. Both figures looked around at the darkness, lit only by the red glow at their feet. They leaned forward and rested against the fairing. The smaller figure made a few extra gestures in the darkness, and then a match light glowed against the end of a stubby cigarillo.

Captain Percy gestured with the glowing coal of the cigarillo out at the darkness. The figure next to her, dwarfing her in size, just nodded. There was no need to describe the all-consuming blackness aloud.

"Fucking perfect night for a surface run." Said the giant figure.

"Perfect night to contemplate your own fucking doom, Hemi." Said Captain Percy.

"It seems that in our business, we're always safest when our doom is closest by. Wear your doom like a blanket, Captain."

"A blanket keeps you warm, our doom is unlikely to be very warm. It's probably best if you keep your fucking imaginative comparisons to fucking yourself Hemi."

"Perhaps so." Hemi paused, there was no reason to rush anything this night. "The usual plan for tonight then?"

"Same as every other fucking night Hemi. Charge up the batteries, run on the surface to the light cracks the sky. Make sure your keep those fucking insolent pissants at the controls awake."

Hemi put one huge hand on her shoulder and turned to climb down through the hatch. Captain Percy pulled on her cigarillo and the coal at the tip glowed in the darkness. Her doom would eventually probably be a doom of freezing, she knew that, but at least tonight it was warm enough to be up on the top of her ship. The blackness lay on it, and she did indeed find it comforting that in the blackness, nobody could see them. If she controlled all the levers of the universe, her boat would never be seen.


### They get rammed by a black sub

Captain Percy stayed on the bridge of the sail for hours, smoking her way through one cigarillo after another, her thoughts spiraling out into the darkness. For a long time it was a study in sensory deprivation. The diesel engines were loud enough but unvarying. So too, the vibration from them that came up through the steel-grate deck and shook her boots never changed in frequency or amplitude. The blackness around her seemed never-ending, though the boat pushed relentlessly forward. It occurred to Captain Percy that when her boat, the _Prospect_ was submerged, this is what it must be like outside --- silent and black. It felt like she had loosed the bonds of her corporal body and had floated outside it, so she could experience what her boat was like when it was pushing through the icy blackness of an alien world where the pressure would collapse a corporal body into a mush of hemoglobin and fats.

As with many things that seem interminable, the slow but persistent forward motion eventually forced the dome of clouds to relent, and they crawled out under a sky of stars and a weak, low moon. Captain Percy could see her hand holding her cigarillo now and the long shadow of the _Prospect_ stretching out before her, parting the waters to allow her to pass as she rode astride this beast of hers.

Captain Percy knew her boat well. She had spent enough time with it to have internalized its movements. She almost always knew what the boat was doing just by the feeling of it --- the angle of the deck, the vibrations of the engines or motors, even at depth, when the struts and structures of the boat groaned under the weight of the water above, the sounds of the boat under pressure felt like the normal sounds of a huge human taking a great weight on its shoulders. The only time she ever worried was when the _Prospect_ conveyed sounds, or motions, or input to her that she couldn't recognize. It was now a collection of haptic feedback to her senses that made her feel a rise of panic in her chest. The boat shuddered, as if the cold water it had swam through all these years had finally gotten a reaction from it. And then Captain Percy was thrown violently against the fairing.

She immediately got down to the deck of the bridge. She stuck her head over the hatch hole and looked down to Hemi's large face looking up at her from a couple of decks below.

"I don't know!" He yelled up to her before she could ask. She could hear him giving orders to shut down the diesel engines and reverse the propellers.

The bow of the _Prospect_ had come to a dead stop, but the stern still had forward motion. Captain Percy could feel the whole boat turning unnaturally around its center axis, like the experiment of a child --- a magnetized pin through a cork floating in a bowl of water, pulled around by the invisible forces of planetary alignment.

The deck under her started to lean to the starboard side. Captain Percy braced one foot against the inside of the bridge well wall. The boat listed sickeningly. Captain Percy got to her feet, still braced against the angle of the boat. She gripped the fairing, peering out over the edge into the night, scanning for a cause. The water was still black and calm, though not quite glassy as it had been earlier in the night. They were far from shore, in fairly well-charted though relatively little-trafficked waters. These should have been safe waters, with nothing to hit.

For a few moments the boat hung at an angle, and then began to right itself. As the fairing came lower, Captain Percy could see more of the sea off to port, and there now rose there the black curve of another submarine. It poked its bow out of the water first, with a modified and reinforced jagged point, a medieval looking device intended for ramming ships. The bow was followed by the long black swelling curve of a military submarine, that rose from the surface with water smoothly flowing off its sides. The sail came up with dive planes on its side, set at an angle to raise the boat quickly. When the stern finally came up to the surface, it was mere meters away, its swirling wake washing white up the against the side of the _Prospect_. 

"...Like Satan dropped a fucking shit on us." Captain Percy said to herself as she climbed down through the hatch and the red crescent of light waned out of existence behind her.


### They crash dive

Captain Percy stood on the metal rungs of the ladder just under the topside hatch, and with one hand screwed shut the squeaking wheel of the hatch seal. She grasped the sides of the ladder and bypassing the rungs slid down into the cramped control room. Hemi looked at her through his small-framed spectacles.

"Down." She gave the one-word order as she pushed the button on the wall that activated the dive alarm. 

"Give me full speed forward." Said Hemi as he put one large hand on each of the shoulders of the two men who sat at the controls of the sub and gave them orders to dive the boat. One of these men was a stick-figure of a man who went by moniker Bastian. The other, Gregory, had a meaty square forehead that echoed his meaty square body. Of the two of them, only Gregory looked like he belonged on a submarine.

Diving the sub required delicacy under the calmest circumstances. Now Hemi and the two men at the controls carefully timed their movements, their eyes scanning continually over the wall of dials and gauges in front of them, reflected in the red glow of the night lighting. Gregory and Bastian made adjustments according to Hemi's instructions by opening and closing various of the dozens of valves in front of them, or flipping on or off switches. The submarine let out a long exhale of breath, the air that had held it aloft being pressed out by an onrush of water from below into the flooding tanks.

"Flood the express dive tank." Ordered Hemi. Bastian reached up and opened a valve and water thrust through thick pipes deep into the deepest parts of the bow of the boat. The bow pitched steeply downwards and Captain Percy reached to grab old leather loops that hung overhead. She angled her feet against the incline and watched the depth gauge. 

The ship-to-ship radio above Captain Percy's head lit up, and over the speaker a recorded voice broadcast a warning that they were violating the territorial waters of someone they had never heard of, authorized by a series of treaties with titles that became acronyms that became words that contributed to further acronyms. The recording ordered them to surface and prepare to be boarded. Hemi punched the mute button on the radio.

"Territories and treaties are for the surface." Said Hemi. Captain Percy nodded.

But she was pissed. "This wouldn't have happened if we had someone listening to the sonar mics while we were running on the surface."

"We wouldn't have heard them coming over the diesels." Replied Hemi.

"We would have fucking known they were there soon enough to take some evasive action at least!"

"Later! We have to deal with being understaffed later. First let's get out from under this asshole."

There was barely enough space in the control room for 4 people. They were all breathing each other's air. Hemi, in his tweed suit, took a rag from a hook and wiped condensation from the glass faces of the dials and gauges, and then wiped the nervous sweat from his hands with the rag. 

"100 meters." Said Gregory.

"OK. Level us off." Said Hemi. Gregory and Bastian spun closed some of the trim tank valves and rolled the dive planes level. The angle of the boat slowly eased upwards. Captain Percy pulled out another cigarillo and lit it. She nervously sucked at it, and then ashed it into a tin cup that smelled of her stale coffee from three hours earlier.


### They realize there's something wrong

"Something isn't right." Said Captain Percy. Just like before when she was on the bridge, she knew something was wrong with her boat. There was no single instrument that reported anything amiss. But then no single instrument on a submarine described the whole being of the boat. They had to be taken together, internalized, and combined with what you felt the boat doing. She had to hold the depth in her head, while taking in the dive plane angle, and the speed. Normally this happened instinctively, she processed it all automatically, and she could just _feel_ what her boat was doing from a quick glance at this wall of dials combined with what her senses told her about the angle of the boat and dead reckoning from the accelerations she had experienced.

But it wasn't working right now. Her eyes scanned back and forth across the dials, but they didn't come together, she couldn't make sense of them, and could not figure out what was happening to her boat. In this steel tube with no windows, for the first time ever, she was truly blind.

"Hemi... what's going on...?"

"Fuck me if I know..." He reached past Gregory and turned the rudder. The boat came along, slowly. "Sluggish?"


### Captain Percy goes looking for what's wrong

"I need to go look her over. Let me know on the PA if something happens." Hemi nodded and Captain Percy slipped down the ladder to the deck below. She passed forward through navigation and sonar and down a steep flight of steel stairs and through the crew quarters where their third deck crew member, Owen, was snoring in his rack behind one of the moth-eaten old bed curtains since he was off watch. At the back of crew quarters, she went down another rusting steel ladder through a hatch to the lowest of the three main decks. If there were something wrong with her boat, this is the deck where it would be.

She flipped on the lights. There was no red night lighting rigged down here, it was just bare white bulbs in a string behind cages to keep them from being broken. In this part of the boat, the entire lower deck was full of batteries, strung together with rat's nest of black cables as thick as her finger. The batteries were bolted with steel straps to row upon row of steel shelves. The straps were rusting away and the cables were grouped together with wire ties and slung along the racks in heavy bundles. The floor was steel grating. She got to her knees, the steel grating pushing through her cracked brown leather pants. She put her fingers through the grating and lifted it up and put it aside. She reached her hand down and felt the raw steel hull of the pressure hull. It was cold, damp, and greasy, but that was normal. She replaced the grate and went on to the next compartment forward.

More batteries here, though fewer. They lined the walls, but not very deeply because there were trim tanks inside the pressure hull in this compartment. She checked below the grating again, but here too everything was normal. She passed forward from that compartment into the main cargo bay.

The main cargo bay was one giant compartment, more than thirty meters long and almost ten meters wide. The air was still and stale and smelled of rust. The lights were a harsh jaundiced yellow color. The hold was mostly empty --- they had been coming from their last dropoff and were heading towards the depots in the north in hopes of being hired for another shipment. A few molding wooden crates were stacked up along the sides, and a pile of rusted bicycles were stacked up and strapped down with leather straps to keep them from shifting in one corner. In another nook was stashed a couple of welding rigs strapped to the wall and some bins of scrap metal. Captain Percy hated that they didn't have a better place to stow this stuff than the cargo hold.

She walked along the center of the space, listening carefully. It seemed to her there was something wrong with the sound of her footsteps on the metal grating. As she got toward the front of the compartment, she realized it wasn't her footsteps, it was that she could hear water trickling. She knelt down and pulled up the grating. There was a lake of oily black water just under the grating. The ramming had cracked the pressure hull, and the _Prospect's_ cargo bay was filling slowly with water.


### Hemi deals with the pursuing sub in the control room

"Keep this depth, and course, I'll be down in sonar listening for our friend." Hemi climbed down to the compartment below. From the sonar station he could still give orders to the control room, and hear reports from Gregory and Bastian. He remained standing at the sonar station, and slipped the old headphones onto his head, covering one ear and leaving the other free.

He spun the control wheel for the sonar around slowly, listening for human sounds out there in the darkness. It was dead silent.

"Hemi," Gregory called down through the hatch, "I'm having trouble keeping the boat level. I find I keep having to give it more dive plane angle just to keep from sinking."

"Let me come up and play with the trim tanks." Said Hemi, climbing back up to the control room. He stood at the trim tank controls and his thick fingers spun one small steel wheel, then the next. Each was accompanied by water pushing through pipes, flowing from one end of the boat to the other. "How's that?" Asked Hemi.

"Better, but still more plane angle that I would expect." Said Gregory.

Hemi didn't say out loud what he was thinking: they were sinking.


### Captain Percy goes to recruit Chips to help fix the leak

"Sweet fucking hell." She said to herself. "Sweet fucking hell!" She yelled. She ran up the cargo bay, and back into the battery compartments. She pulled the heavy watertight bulkhead closed behind her, and turned the wheel to seal it. It took all her strength, these seal were rarely used and steadily rusting themselves into stasis.

She climbed up a deck, and went back into the engine room, where the only sound was the quiet hum of the electric motors running in the next compartment back, and a clanking of tools from the deck below. She leaned over the open hatch to the lower engine room.

"Chips! Chips, come over here."

The clanking sound stopped and the face of the _Prospect's_ engineer peered up at her. Chips wore leather overalls stained with grease, and had her hair tied back in a thick black braid. Her hands were black with grease and were holding the body of a small deconstructed piece of machinery, as if she had been butchering some small game animal for dinner.

"Feck's up?"

"There's a leak." These were words no submariner ever wanted to hear. But Chips had fixed leaks before. It was the answer to the next question that Captain Percy didn't want to have to give.

"Yar. Where's it?"

"...In the cargo bay."

"And it's bad, ah?"

"Pretty fucking bad."

"So we're feckin fecked then, ah? Feckin fecked, cuz the cargo bay's too big, and the boat won't feckin float if's flooded. ah Capt' Percy? Feckin fecked!" She threw her piece of machinery at the wall where it clanged and sent small part flying into far dirty corners of the lower engine room.

"For fuck's sake Chips, yes we're fucked, but we're not _fuckin'_ fucked yet... I need you to take one of the guys, go in there, and see if you can stop it and patch it so we don't get to the point where we _are_ fuckin' fucked. Move!"

"Ah, feck ya Capt." Chips started climbing up the ladder.

"Good or bad, I want regular reports Chips. Get Owen up and get him helping you."

"ah feckin kay."

A loud ringing ping echoed through the steel hull of the boat. It hit them broadside, and passed through them. It rang off the opposite side of the hull and echoed back through the air to their ears. 

"Ah, and someone's feckin' hunting us too!" Cursed Chips.

"Go!" Said Captain Percy. She left Chips digging out patch kits and her welding rig and went back up to the control room.

Hemi looked at her. "I guess they have no reason to fear giving away their position to us with an active sonar ping, since we have nothing to shoot at them." 

"Someday, Hemi, I'll make the _Prospect_ the first merchant sub with a torpedo tube just for you. Til then, we're just a small prey animal and our defense is to run and hide."

"There's no hiding for us right now. If you're back in the control room for the moment, I'll go down to sonar to keep tabs on them. How's the boat, by the way?"

"We're sinking. I put Chips on it." 

"Well, if she can patch the boat with expletives and downright pissed-offedness, we're in good shape then."


### Percy looks at the situation in the conn

"What's the state of my ship boys?" Captain Percy asked Gregory and Bastian.

"Apparently we're fucking sinking." Answered Gregory. 

"Apparently..." She agreed. She scanned the dials. There was nothing immediate in their impending doom. It was written instead in subtle ways across the dials, and when taken together. The dive plane angle was too steep for the amount of forward drive they were giving the boat. The trim tanks too light, the depth deeper than she wanted to be.

"Since they know where we are anyway, you might as well crank the bilge pumps up to maximum power. Better to make a bunch of noise than to sink."

Gregory flipped some switches and another frequency of vibration was added to the regular background hum from the motors propelling the boat.

"How's she handling generally?" Captain Percy asked.

"The boat just doesn't seem normal. It doesn't respond the way I want it to." Said Bastian.

"Here, let me try the rudder." Captain Percy turned the rudder wheel hard over. The _Prospect_ came about slowly but surely, she leaned over slightly, as she should, but then the whole boat leaned more sharply. Percy counter-steered and brought her back to the course they had been on.

"See? That doesn't seem quite OK to me." Said Bastian.

Captain Percy knew it was more than not OK. The delay before the sharp lean was the weight of the slack water in the bilge pouring over to one side of the boat and forcing her to lean.


### Percy goes to check on Chips' progress

"I... need to go check on Chips." She slid back down the ladder, patted Hemi on the back as she walked past him, and down the forward stairs to the cargo hold. Chips and Owen were at the far end, with bright work lamps rigged up. Owen was running a fat filthy hose for an old mobile bilge pump from the lake up the length of the cargo bay intending to connect it up to one of the trim tanks. Chips had a whole set of the grates out and stacked up. She was wearing thick rubber waders and standing directly on the inside of the pressure hull in the slick black water. The water had reached above the grating level and was almost to Chips chest, though she was not a very tall woman. She had heavy rubber welding gloves on, and a mask so she could see what she was doing under the water. When she lifted her head up for air, water ran down her mask in rivulets, and drained in a greasy gray stream from her thick braid of hair.

Captain Percy stood on the grating above her watching her latest attempt at welding shut the leak under the water. When she raised her head again Captain Percy asked her to report.

"Ah feck ya, ya goddamn dominating twat. This is delicate work here, and it needs time. It's a'hundreds of tiny cracks, the hull splitted open the way ya might break off a piece of cheese --- with tiny cracks. If'n were one big crack t'would be much simpler."

Captain Percy spat, and her spit tasted oily and gritty to her, like the bilge water filling her boat. "Keep trying. I'm going to blow the tanks and bring us up to the surface."

"Ah, feckin smartest thing ya said yet this day, ya fucker. This course we're pursuin' right now is'na trackway to the gates 'a hell."

Blowing the tanks was an emergency maneuver. It meant opening the valves that would allow air to flow through the rusty old pipes of the ship and push into the tops of the main ballast tanks. The air forced in the top of the tanks would push water out the bottom. When enough water was forced out, the huge bubbles of air, stale and foul as it might be, would lift the rickety old up to the surface. Blowing out the tanks was only ever done in emergencies and drills, and drills were few and far between on a transport sub like the _Prospect_. It would be a risky move.


### Percy blows the tanks

Captain Percy headed back up the stairs to the control room. As she passed Hemi at the sonar she told him she was blowing the tanks. He nodded. "What about the sub following us?" He asked.

"We've crossed that line of risk, we're better off with them than down here now." She replied.

In the control room, she knelt down and opening a long thin toolbox bolted to the wall near the floor. From it she took a wrench as long as forearm, wrapped in a thick grease-stained rag. She fitted the end of it over a nut that was set in a fat pipe running along the wall.

"OK guys, I'm blowing the tanks." She warned the control room, and then turned the wrench until it was horizontal, aligned with the old pipe. Then she did it again with the sister pipe running just above it. A loud rush of moving air, under immense pressure, hissed through the pipe. All through the ship the sound of air pressing water out of the ship, changing the very mass of the ship itself.

"Take us up guys. Set the dive planes, and blow any trim tanks you haven't yet." Percy said to Gregory and Bastian. They turned the control wheels, the bow the of boat rose slowly, gently. Captain Percy looked across the dials. Once again they weren't reading what they should. Once again, something was wrong. "We're not going up fast enough..."

"We're not going up at all." Said Bastian. "Fuck me."

Percy went over each instrument, and the took the setting of each wheel into her head. "Hemi! She called down to him. "Hemi! We're not rising! The forward ballast didn't blow! They must have crushed the high pressure pipes when they rammed us."

Hemi looked up at her through his small glasses frames, his face only a few fingers widths from the hatch opening because he was so large. "Captain Percy," he said, "I think we need to start thinking about more drastic measures to get us back on the surface."


### Percy blows the fuel ballast

"The fuel ballast?"

"Yes, I think we should dump the diesel at this point. Even if we get to the surface, we could lose the boat if the cargo bay keeps flooding and we can't figure out how to empty it. That's a bigger risk than not having enough fuel to get to port if we can manage to stay on the surface."

Captain Percy considered. But sometimes considerations are meaningless. They had passed the point of developing a strategy to evade their pursuers. For a submarine captain, the situation she now faced was the single biggest nightmare: get to the surface at any cost. Knowing that, the decision to blow out the fuel ballast tanks --- to dump all their diesel in the ocean --- was not even one that had to be made.

There were in fact two long thin toolboxes bolted to the wall. One had the main ballast tank blow wrench, which she had already used. The boat was also provisioned with another toolbox that was padlocked. It contained the fuel ballast blow wrench. Just like the main ballast, the fuel tanks could be blown out with high pressure air too. The difference was that blowing the fuel out of the boat might give them an emergency pocket of air to lift them to the surface, but it left them without fuel.

Captain Percy was the only person who carried the key to this second toolbox. She unlocked it and withdrew another wrapped wrench the same length as the tank blow wrench. But this one had a special 5-sided socket that would only fit the nut to open the air line into the fuel ballast tanks. As before, she fitted the wrench onto one air pipe, then the second. Percy was pretty sure these valves had never been turned before, not even in a drill. They had been painted over many times over the years. She had to put all of her weight onto the end of the lever, and then reach for a spare length of pipe kept in the main ballast wrench toolbox to get some more leverage on the wrench.

It slowly and sqeakingly turned under all her weight as she let out a straining groan.

And another rush of high pressure air pushed through the ship. And their precious diesel fuel --- the only way to shore, was pushed out into the deep waters of the ocean.

"Now... now are we fucking rising?" Percy asked after a few minutes. But she was looking at the same gauges as everyone else. She could read them as well as anyone else.

Gregory was tentative. "We're... holding steady."

Owen, the youngest of the crew stuck his head up through the hatch while he stood on the ladder up to the control room. "Captain, Chips wants me to tell you that the cracks are splitting wider, and the flooding in the cargo bay is getting worse."

"Sweet fuck." Said Gregory.

"Can't we surface Captain?" Owen asked.

"Go back and help Chips. Do anything she asks of you."

"Alrighty." And Owen's head disappeared back from whence it came.


### Percy decides to head for the bottom

Percy was running out of ideas. It was easy when the only decision was to get to the surface at all costs while there still remained some levers to pull and options to engage. But now nothing remained that she could think of that would push them back towards the surface. She cleared her mind. The surface seemed so far away. The surface wasn't her natural environment anyway. Up there was war, borderlines, treaties, enforcers and authorities. Up there was conflict, nations, and bureaucracy. Underwater was where she belonged, where they were free to go where they liked, when they liked, by virtue of the exponentially huge amount of room provided by being able to move along the Z axis. Still, she had no desire to die down here. And no matter how safe and free underwater felt, there was always that yawning gulf under them, a black, cold, bottomless hell. Once you go _too_ far down, you go down forever. She wanted to be free, but she didn't want that.

She put the idea of the surface out of her mind. What if they did go down instead of up? What if they could find safety and respite in the deep?

She slipped down to the navigation and sonar compartment, where Hemi was still listening on the sonar headset. "Hemi, how deep is it here?"

"1000 meters, give or take. Essentially bottomless."

"Hmm." She went to the charts. The navigation station sat on top of a stack of flat files. Behind, rolls of charts that were more commonly used were stacked between upright stakes. When they had the white lights on, the charts showed their age, yellowed and flaking at the edges. Hemi had their current position marked with a grease pencil on a glass sheet laying over the chart showing their position. The black smudges trailed up away from the shore they had left days before. They were in the goddamned middle of the ocean. It was a wasteland, far from any continental shelf or island that they could make it to on battery power alone, while slowly sinking. She pulled down a magnifier that hung from the ceiling by a retractable string. She looked closely at the grease markings on the chart, and the depth markings around them. "Hemi... come here." He put down the headphones, through which he was hearing nothing anyway and came over. She pointed to a spot on the map. "Figure out how to get us here. I'll be trying to eek out every ounce of buoyancy from my boat, and see how long we can last."

Hemi peered through the magnifier, and then pulled his slide rule from his pocket. He made some adjustments, some marks with the grease pencil on the glass, he touched his fingertips with the point of the pencil while muttering some numbers out loud. "I don't know if we can do it. Keep me informed of our exact depth, speed, and most importantly the rate we are sinking at."

Captain Percy smiled. "You keep me informed of the math." And climbed up to the control room.


### They make the run for the tablemount 

In the control room, Captain Percy gave Bastian and Gregory a new heading. "You guys have to do everything you can to keep us up, like gliding an airplane."

"What about our friendly local authority sub pursuing us? Won't they shoot?"

"We're too deep. They won't shoot. With our bilge pumps running flat out they can hear exactly where we are, and know we're in trouble. All they have to do is wait for us to sink or surface."

"How reassuring."

"Hemi!" Captain Percy called down through the hatch. "I want to go as fast as possible. How fast is possible?"

"What's the battery charge?"

"About two-thirds."

"I don't think you should push it beyond 10 knots. At that rate you'll run the batteries down to empty in two hours or so. We're going to need every minute of that two hours.

"Make it 10 knots Bastian." Bastian reached out a long skinny arm and adjusted the throttle controls until the speed indicated 10 knots.

Percy couldn't wait for Hemi. She started muttering her own equations to herself. "We're already almost 190 meters down. She's rated to 230 --- but that's without cracks in the pressure hull. We need to make it 20 nautical miles. The key question is: how fast are we sinking?"

"We really need to know how fast we're sinking." She said out loud. "Gregory, do you have any sense of it?"

"Well, barring us finding any reserve buoyancy, we're going down a couple of meters every nautical mile or so."

"That might be enough..." Captain Percy whispered to herself.


### staring at dials: depth vs the tablemount

Now it was nothing but staring at the dials. The wall of dials and gauges in front of them with their spindly little black fingers, all inching slowly one way or another depending on what they were tasked with. The individual parts the dials had to play all came together in a symphony that marked time towards their doom.

Nearly every gauge mattered to Captain Percy right now. Nearly every one represented  a variable in the equation that controlled whether they lived or died: speed, battery charge, battery drain rate, the status of the trim tanks, course, rudder, ship angle, dive plane angle... everything mattered. But as in every equation some variables weighed more than others. The two that mattered most to Captain Percy right now were the depth of ship gauge (which mattered in every submarine maneuver of course) and depth under keel (which told them how far the ocean bottom was under them, and rarely mattered in a submarine maneuver).

The depth of the boat was slowly, slowly creeping downwards. She stared at the black line of the needle on the dial, and willed it to stay still. She was pretty sure Gregory and Bastian were doing the same. But it never stopped its shaky wavering, and it persistently wavered towards the deep end of the dial. It had already crept three quarters of the way around the dial --- on a dial that was graduated in such a way that the far end, where its tiny steel bounding needle poked up, was beyond the capabilities of what the ship could survive.

They had watched it travel that distance the way one might track a long journey on a map. It seemed they had traveled interminably far to get where they were, and they looked back at the three quarters of the dial they had passed the way the way one remembers days and days on the road in a long cross-country journey. But in actual physical distance, it was no more than one might walk in a few minutes to buy a bottle of milk from the store.

But the gauge that mattered most to Captain Percy right now was that depth under keel gauge. The instrumentation that fed that gauge was only so sensitive. It could show the depth of the bottom far beyond what the submarine was capable of, but nowhere near the depths of the deep ocean. At the far end of that dial, it's bounding gauge was cutely labeled, in an ancient naval tradition, "Bottomless." 
And it really did not matter that somewhere down there might be an actual bottom. For this sub, for their pursuing sub, for any submarine that Captain Percy had ever heard about, the deep ocean was in all practical ways a never-ending depth. Anything that went down there could never find a bottom, and could never come back up. They lived much of their submariner lives floating on delicate bubbles of gas over that black hole that always wanted to suck them down.  The needle of the depth under keel dial had been pegged at "Bottomless" for days now as they have been crossing deep ocean.

Hemi came up through the hatch into the control room with a clipboard and a pencil, and leaned over the glowing red dials, raising his little glasses with his fingers to bring them into sharper focus. He jotted readings off the dials down on his clipboard. 

Captain Percy fished her hand around among the joists that supported the pressure hull wall, and found a rumpled pack of cigarillos. She shook one out and lit it. "Are we going to make it Hemi?"

"It's fucking razor work Captain. Numbers slide past numbers, and decimal points worth of differences change whether we live or die here... and if the numbers work out in our favor, there's no saying whether, should your plan succeed initially, that it doesn't simply perpetrate the complete failure of the pressure hull and doom us all anyway."

"I'm entirely open to other ideas here." This elicited dead silence in the control room. "Alright then we keep pushing those numbers then. In a matter of an hour or so, we'll know whether our fates have been pinched off, or granted a short stay longer on this sea of ours." She sucked slowly on her cigarillo.

A third gauge now entered as a heavy variable in Captain Percy's equation: the clock. The fact that they other gauges all moved so slowly, and the clock moved quickly and steadily did not provide a sense of relief. 

She stared intently at the clock, willing it to move slower. Her eyes wandered back and forth from it to the depth-under-keel gauge, where she stared at the needled and summoned all the metaphysical powers of the universe to move the needle up off the "Bottomless" pin. She thought she saw it writhe for a split instant, like the flash of a small bait fish seen catching the sun in a shallow pool of water. 

She stood and took a rag from a hook and reached over Gregory to wipe the condensing droplets of water off the glass of the gauge, then circled around the aging pitted chrome casing for good measure. She could feel the little spots of rust and degrading metal catching against the fibers of the rag. She tapped the glass with her finger.


### They land on the tablemount

And the needle moved.

It just wavered, hovered for a second above the pin, and then returned to resting wearily on the pin. But it had definitely moved. Her eyes went back to the clock, more minutes passed. To their speed: steady at 10 knots. To their battery charge: painfully low. To their depth: too deep for comfort.

But the depth-under-keel needle moved again, rising up and falling back, like a dying crone trying to raise herself for one last curse at her hated relations. And again. And then it was wavering unsteadily above the "Bottomless" pin. The gap between the needle and the pin was tenuous, but real. The bottom was coming up under them.

Captain Percy reached above her head for a strap. "Drive boys, Drive." The bottom was still far far below them, so far down that if the boat went down now the _Prospect_ would be crushed into nothing but a greasy stain on that bottom. But it was at least a measurable distance now instead of an unknowable nothingness.

Minutes later the depth-under-keep gauge started rising steadily, like it had intention. It gave the impression that they were moving quickly, though in fact their speed remained steady, while the slope of the bottom had drastically increased, and was rapidly rising under them, a sheer undersea mountain wall. The depth-under-keel needle rose shockingly fast, in a way that might give the impression they were about to smack into a mountainside, from which they would slide helplessly back into the black pit. Instead, the needle shot up and back to 250 meters, and then stayed hovering at that level.

"OK Gregory, now the fucking stupid part: give me a gentle dive plane down angle."

"You want to go _down_?"

"Down Gregory. Now. Take us to the bottom."

The dive plane wheel slipped through Gregory's grimey fat hands, and the bow of the boat eased downwards. Captain Percy pressed the collision alarm button and a klaxon blaired through the ship. She pulled the boat PA mic down from the array of radio mics hanging from the ceiling and pressed the talk button. "Chips: leave the leak and you and Owen get out of the cargo hold, and seal the bulkheads behind you. We're going to bottom the boat, and there's a reasonable chance it will split our wound wide open."

At the sound of the collision alarm Hemi came up through the hatch. His eyes passed over the gauges taking in their situation. "Gently Gregory." He almost whispered.

"Yes fucking gently." Followed up Percy, "as gentle as you've ever been, like you're laying down a fevered child. Bastian, disengage the motor. Lets use only what's left of our forward momentum, and let our leaking boat take us down the way she wants to."

Slowly, slowly, the depth gauge needle turned to the right as the boat sank. Slowly, slowly, the depth-under-keep gauge turned to the left as the bottom rose. The depth gauge showed 250 meters. The depth-under-keel gauge came to rest on its other limit pin, labeled '0'. And at that moment the whole boat trembled as the bow touched the bottom. Captain Percy felt the slight angle under her feet relax as the stern came down slowly and rested on the bottom too.

"Jeesus." Said Bastian. "The fucking bottom. At 250 meters! On a undersea mountain top, landed like fucking Noah."

"Technically a tablemount." Said Hemi. "A relatively flat surface worn down from an ancient volcano. And yes, if you like, very much antediluvian."

"Deeper than she's rated for," added Percy, "but not by much. If the pressure hull holds, we have bought ourselves a little time. But it's just as fucking likely that the cargo bay is now completely split open and we will die here. So don't get your hopes up."

"As a bonus, we'll blend in with the bottom on sonar. Our pursuing friends will not be able to see us, and will likely assume we sank." Said Hemi.

"Which, we in fact did," added Percy "and I would not be the one to correct their thinking that we will never rise to the surface again."


### Repairs on the bottom

It was time for Captain Percy to survey the damage. She got on the ship PA and told Chips to meet her at the entrance to the cargo bay, before slipping down the ladder and heading down there herself.

Percy found Chips waiting for her at the bulkhead entrance to the cargo bay in the forward battery room on the bottom deck of the boat. Chips had a large wrench with her and as soon as Percy arrived she banged with it on the bulkhead. "Well Capt, it soundser fuckin hollah to me. Still air on the other side of the bulkhead a' leasts."

Percy nodded and cranked open the rusting sealing wheel, which squeaked painfully in her ears. The lights were out in the cargo bay, so they were looking into blackness, but the air smelled wet, which disturbed both of them instinctively and immediately. Percy reached around and flipped on the lights. The white overheads glared down on her cargo bay. The steel grating led down a very gently slope into an oily, black subterranean lake that was filling the lower front part of her cargo hold. A couple of empty wooden crates floated like lost viking craft on it. The sound echoed through the giant empty space and over the water. A film of black frothing grease floated in patches on it.

"That's a'fuckin nightmare." Said Chips.

"Fuck. We probably did more damage to her when we pressed her bow into the bottom. Like levering apart the bones of a fowl. We don't have much time. What do you need Chips?"

"Ah just feckin send Owen back down. An it looks like ay'll be breathin through a feckin hose while I'm doin' the stitchin' back t'gether now."

"Fuckin' alright Chips. I'll get Gregory and Bastian looking for some more portable bilge pumps, run some hose down and see if we can't get some of this water into the trim tanks and back out into the ocean where it belongs."

"Feck yas."

### Percy goes back upstairs, rouses the boys, gets coffee

Percy headed back up to the control room. She found Gregory and Bastian crawling into their bunks in crew quarters having been released from control duty by Hemi. Their eyes were slitted and bleary and they were not being entirely successful in their attempts to climb into their racks.

"Come'on dickwads, you can't sleep yet. Get some coffee and then go find some portable bilge pumps. We need to get this boat pumped out, or you'll never wake up from yer little beauty naps."

She left them groaning and headed to the galley, thinking coffee sounded like a good idea. There was a tin cup sitting upside down in the drying rack. It was one of those blue tin cups with the white flecks. The outside of it had been dipped in rubber as a way to market the cups to submariners. Those cups always tasted unpleasantly like metal to Percy. This one was relatively clean, just the usual semi-permanent coffee stains. The coffee in the pot had been in there on the warmer for hours. Maybe days, who knew. She poured it into her cup and added a couple of scoops of sugar. The taste was foul, like what she always imagined "sweet crude" must taste like. Her tastebuds rebelled, but the rest of her body knew better, and she felt immediately better.

There situation was dire. They were still terribly unlikely to survive this. If being flooded and bottomed had been the worst thing that happened today, she would have been upset. But somehow the relative safety they had now compared to where they had been an hour before, slowly sinking over a black gulf, made her feel surprisingly relaxed. Relaxed enough to enjoy a cup of burnt coffee at least.


### Percy talks to Hemi about surviving their immediate futures

Percy found another relatively clean tin cup in the dish cabinet and filled it with coffee. She brought it to Hemi at the navigation station.

Hemi took the cup and held it to his lips blowing the burnt smell off the surface. His glasses steamed up. "Chips have the leak under control?"

"Eh. It's deep under water now. She's going to have to dive down there to weld it."

"Fuck."

"That's right."

"Even if we get it sealed, even if we can manage to pump out, even if we get to the surface, it doesn't look good. We're nowhere right now, and of course we have no fuel or battery."

"Still'd rather be there than here."

"I'm just trying to get ahead of the problem. We're in a situation where we need to overcome a whole series of challenges, each in their particular order. It would be the ignorant motherfucker who doesn't think ahead."

"And you think I'm that ignorant motherfucker? You keep doing the thinking ahead Hemi. You let me know if I'm not considering something that impacts our future survivability. But otherwise I need to focus on surviving our situation right now. And that currently means getting some of this foul black water out of my boat."

He nodded and she patted his huge tweedy shoulder. 


### repairing and pumping out the cargo hold

Back through the crew quarters and down the steep flight of steel stairs into the cargo hold. Bastian and Gregory were laying out heavy cloth-covered hoses down the center of the cargo bay and hooking them up to portable electric bilge pumps the size of small refrigerators.

Owen had his own electric pump, a smaller one, and was feeding an air hose to Chips who was in water over her head with a welding torch in one hand and wearing a diving mask that was connected to the air host. The welding torch was connected by hoses to welding tanks in a rack with wheels propped at the shore of the lake filling the cargo bay.

Chips dove down and there was a quiet moment before a hot blue light lit up the black lake from under the surface, wavered for a for moments, and then died away. This repeated a few times before Chips' head broke back through the surface. She ripped off the diving mask. "Own! I need another piece of steel plate, and another brace."

"Alrighty Chips!" Called the kid from the shore. Owen was wearing the same greasy-slick rubber waders Chips had had on earlier. He selected some metal bits from a pile of scraps piled on the grating next to the welding tanks and waded into the foul bilge to hand them to Chips.

Every sound in the cargo bay echoed back and forth off the exposed steel inner side of the pressure hull. That was normal, and Captain Percy was used to it. What really ate at her instincts though was the way the pool of water filling one end of the cargo bay changed the sound. It was hard to pin down precisely how it changed. It sounded like a room with a pool for athletics. It was a quality of sound that should never be heard on a submarine.

She sipped her coffee and watched Chips dive again with her plates in one hand. More blue light from under the water. Percy had an idea to go and track down a meter stick and prop it in the water, so they could all see when the water started to lower. But then thought better of that, considering the strong possibility of the water quickly rising over the top of the stick.

Instead she helped Gregory and Bastian get the bilge hoses connected to the trim tanks and got them cranking. The hoses inflated with the pressure of the water running up the gentle grade from the pumps. She could hear it pouring into the empty trim tanks.


### Percy inspects the damage

While Chips was on shore trying to find a particular patch piece she wanted in the scrap pile, Percy took the mask and waded into the water to get a good look at the damage. The water was the freezing-cold and never-changing temperature of deep-ocean water. The water had picked up an unpleasant array of smells though, a mix of petro-chemicals and solvents, refuse, and old grease --- the stuff that always contaminated a boat's bilge, but lifted up by the sheer volume of water to Percy's face. 

The damage was bad. As Chips had said earlier, it wasn't one big split in the metal, it was a long string of side-by-side cracks. She put her hand out in front of her mask, holding it over the cracks, and she could feel the onrush of the icy water pressing against her warm flesh. Chips' patches were pieces of curved steel that she was welding into place over the cracks. Chips was no expert at underwater welding, and the welds were globulous and imprecise. It was starting to look like a mess, but Percy didn't know what else she could do. She climbed back out of the water shivering and dripping oily droplets that clung together unnaturally. Percy always thought of herself as pretty tough. But in many ways Chips, with her foul language and bad attitude, was a lot tougher. Chips had never even mentioned the temperature of the water.

With the extra bilge pumps running she let Gregory and Bastian go stumble up to their racks to lie down. They slept through the next six hours or so of work while she, Owen, and Hemi did whatever they could to help Chips get the hull welded back together. Patching the boat was the only thing that mattered right now, and Chips was the only one who could do the welding. Percy, Hemi, and Owen found themselves standing around smoking and drinking coffee more than actually helping, so Percy sent Hemi and Owen to their racks too.

Percy needed sleep more than anyone, but she knew there was no way she could sleep. Maybe, maybe once they got to the surface. She smoked up one cigarillo after cup of coffee after cigarillo. When Chips needed something she was there, but mostly Chips had her own method and didn't really want any help. When Chips disappeared below the surface it became totally silent in the cargo bay. Percy looked at her watch --- where time had been so relentless before, now it barely moved. Because of that it took her maybe more than an hour to realize that the water level had receded a bit, leaving an greasy black line on the pressure hull marking its high-water mark.

Now Percy let herself have some small amount of hope. The water level going down was everything. The boat didn't need power, or the high-pressure air system, or a running motor to reach the surface --- all the needed was that water level to go down, physics would take care of everything else.

She waited for Chips to raise her head above the surface again. "Chips! The water level is dropping!" Percy shouted to her, while pointing at the black line of grit on the pressure hull.

"Ah feckin sure. I've patched so much is 'bout feckin time."

"I have to go up to the control room --- there's really no way to know when we'll get buoyant again, and someone has to be there if we do."

"Ah!" Chips gruffed. She waved a hand and disappeared back under the surface.


### Percy back in the control room; staring at dials again

As Captain Percy passed through the crew quarters she shook the kid Owen awake again. "I have to go to the control room. Go down and watch Chips and make sure she doesn't die." Percy knew it would be incredibly stupid to let someone, even someone as tough as Chips, do underwater welding without someone keeping an eye out.

Owen didn't say anything but resignedly rolled out of his rack to his feet, and rubbed his eyes before heading back down to the cargo bay.

Percy climbed up into the control room and sat at one of the maneuvering stations. The familiar dials and gauges once again spread out in front of her. The readings hadn't changed at all since she last left them, obviously. She looked around, and it was a moment before she realized that she would know the boat was rising before any of the gauges showed it. The water was being drained out so slowly that it wasn't like the boat would just pop off the bottom. She would feel the slight incline it had taken on settling into the bottom come off first. The boat righting itself would be the first indication it was rising, and she didn't need gauges for that.

She returned to her feet, fished her control-room cigarillo back from its nook in the wall and lit up. With nothing that mattered to look at, she started pacing unconsciously back and forth. How long now? She looked at her watch, but realized as soon as she did that that particular gauge didn't really matter either.

She glanced over at the control gauges and just as she did, she saw the angle-of-the-boat gauge waver slightly back and forth in its little glass tube. Ah! She was wrong. The gauges might know first! But seconds later she did feel it. The deck under her feet changed inclination every so slightly, She reached up and grabbed a strap, and then the whole boat lifted ever so slightly towards level.

"Fuck me! The trim tanks!" Percy remembered they had been pumping bilge water into them, but that water was still physically still inside the boat. She noted there was reasonable pressure still in the high-pressure system and reached over to the ballast panel and opened the valve that would blow out the trim tanks full of bilge water.

There was the usual loud hiss, a moment passed, and then the bow of the boat jumped off the bottom, followed quickly by the stern. The depth-under-keel gauge snapped up to two meters. She could hear suddenly-wakened crew members cursing loudly up at her from the crew quarters. She grabbed the boat PA mic "Fellows! We have positive fuckin' bouancy!"


### A fight with Chips

Up instead of down felt great. A relief in the change of environmental motion that only someone who has acutely attuned themselves to three-dimensional space could experience. 

As soon as Percy had blown out the trim tanks, there was no stopping her. It was a slow rise, weighted as she was by the tons of extra weight in water still sloshing around in the cargo hold. It was nothing like the violent rise that an emergency blow would illicit had the _Prospect_ been functioning normally. But they were steadily rising.

Hemi popped up in the control room and stood watching the gauges, smiling a quiet smile of intellectual satisfaction. 

"Hemi, don't just stand there like a fuckin' idiot." Percy said to him. "Sit at the controls and make sure nothing stupid happens." Hemi nodded and slipping into a control chair made some adjustments to the dive planes while Percy balanced the trim tanks so they didn't go bow up.

A banging and cursing came up to them through from the crew quarters, and a second later Chips climbed up into the control room, leaving a small puddle of black water at the base of the ladder, and a thin trail of the foul stuff behind her as she walked up to Percy. She was holding a length of steel bracing pipe in her hand.

"Ah ya feckin' stupid twat, ya almos' killed me! Wha fuckd stupid idea came to yer hed to blow the trem tanks with no warnin to me? I was feckin washed half-way down the 'old!"

"Oh fuck me." Said Percy, realizing her deadly mistake. "Fuck me!" In all they had been through since the black sub rammed them, this was the first time she felt real panic. It was true: she could easily have killed Chips.

"Ya feck yoursef!" Chips was red and as angry as Captain Percy had ever seen that little perpetually pissed-off imp. Chips had no tolerance for stupidity in general, but when it was a matter where stupidity might get someone killed, she got ripshit. She kept raising the pipe in her hand like she was going to move it up to a position to take a swing at Percy.

Percy put up one hand. "Put the fucking pipe down Chips. You're absolutely right, I made a mistake. We're in a dangerous fucking business, you know that."

"If'n I go down that's my fate, but I'll feckin damn you from the beyond, I'll feckin come back and feckin _haunt_ the feckin shadows of your remainin' life if'n is cuz of stupid feckin twat-brain moves liken that!"

"It won't happen again, Chips. I promise you that. I fucking need you! That hole in my boat isn't wholly patched yet, and we're not going to make it to a place where it can be fixed unless you can keep this boat together." This appeal to her necessity softened Chips a bit. It was just so obviously true. They were doomed without Chips. They might be doomed anyway, but surely doomed without Chips. "Give me the pipe, Chips." Chips handed her the pipe. "Go lay down. She'll hold together long enough for you to get a bit of rest now."

"Naa. Yer feckin right --- the patch needs more werk. I'm heading back down to the cargo bay."

"Don't do anything stupid on account of lack of fucking rest --- that isn't on me."

Chips nodded and backed slowly down the ladded out of the control room.

"We all need rest Capt." Said Hemi.

"Welp, we make it to the surface, and if we can _stay_ on the surface, y'all can take a little nap."

"That sounds better than a week's pay right now."


### Surfaced

The _Prospect_ climbed slowly upwards. It tilted a little on one axis, then the other as Captain Percy adjusted the trim of the tanks, but more or less the boat rose straight up, since they didn't have the motors running and it was pure buoyancy alone that lifted it.

Percy and Hemi watched the depth gauge slowly roll itself backwards, up past their test depth, up into what Percy would normally consider safe operating depth, then periscope depth, and then the sail broke through the surface. The guys in the crew quarters could feel the boat bob like a cork to the surface, and they all cheered and ran to the bottom of the ladder up to the control room, obviously expecting to be allowed out on deck.

At first, Captain Percy wasn't even going to think about allowing that. Years of experience had ground into her the notion that you don't surface a sub and not look around before popping open hatches. There was always a chance that the only safe move was to dive right back down. But she fought back this instinct within herself --- there was nothing on the surface that could be more dangerous than attempting to dive her damaged boat again. She looked down at her crew and waved them up through the control room.

Owen, with his scrawny youthful energy, led the way and charged up the ladder, struggled with the tightly closed (and somewhat rusted) hatch-seal wheel for a moment before it squeakingly eased open and then pushed the hatch open.

On a submarine, one never seriously realizes how stale and still the air can be until a moment like this. Daylight poured down through the hatch into the control room below. With it came cool, moving air. It was air that smelled of the open sea instead of human bodies, oil, and diesel exhaust. The entire crew followed Owen out onto the bridge.

It was a cool mildly breezy day. Gray clouds hung low overhead, and there was a mild chop on the water. It couldn't be more perfect, as far as they were concerned. Owen climbed over the fairing and down the rungs on the side of the sail to the main deck and ran up and down it shrieking like a small child. 

"Hemi, you were looking at the charts, who controls this part of the surface these days?" Percy asked.

"Umm, maybe the Western Federated Socialists? At least, they did the last time I looked at a Territorial Authorities map. But that was more than a year ago."

"Those assholes are bad news, and have no tolerance for surface transports --- even when they have papers." Put in Bastian. "We should not stay here."

"We would be on our way... if we had any fuel or power. That lovely sound you hear of gentle waves smacking against our hull is the sound of a boat not moving. We're dead in the water, and We're still a bit fucked folks."

"Owen!" She called down to the deck. "Get back up here, we have to get back to work." As he ran over and started climbing back up the side of the sail she gave orders. "Chips, take Owen and get back down to your patch. Make it as tight as you can. We have to get it sealed up before our batteries die completely and we can't pump any more water out of the bilge.

"Hemi, get down to the navigation chart and see if there's any hope of any place we could limp to with what battery we have left.

"Bastian, get on the radio and see if you can raise anyone on the Independent Operators frequency. Maybe we'll get extraordinarily fucking lucky and find some help from someone who won't ask to many questions."

"Or try to sink us." Hemi put in.

"Ya. Bastian: if you do raise anyone don't actually talk to them. And don't _tell_ them anything. Just come get me and I'll try to gauge their reliability myself."

"Sure Capt." Said Bastian.

"Gregory... I'm starving, want to see if you can something going in the galley?"

"Sounds good boss."

"And put a new pot of coffee on too. The shit in there now has been on that burner so long it looks like bunker fuel."

Chips had already taken Owen back down below, and the rest of them now followed them down, but left the hatch open and for the next few hours a blessed breeze blew down through the control room and reached occasional tendrils of sea air as far into the boat as the crew quarters.


### On the radio

Inside the sub, Percy joined Hemi at the navigation table.

"The most pressing problem" said Hemi, not even waiting for her to ask, "is the batteries are almost gone. Even running extremely judiciously, we have a range of a few nautical miles at best." He used a compass to draw a dotted line around their position showing what was within range. It was a completely barren section of the chart. The middle of the ocean. It was nowhere.

"Not even close huh? Well, that just leaves help from someone."

"Most folks in these neglected waters are not much inclined to help those they don't know."

"We'll just have to hope we don't meet most fuckin' folks then."

She headed up to the control room to see how Bastian was doing with that goal. He had one stick-arm up in the air, adjusting some dials on the radio mounted in the ceiling of the control room. His other hand held the mic that was attached by a curling wire to the radio. He was giving out mayday requests on a couple of different frequencies known to be monitored by other independent shipping operators like themselves, both legitimate transporters and smugglers. But those frequencies were also monitored by Authority vessels that might be engaged in policing shipping and transport traffic. 

"Anything Bastch?"

"Nothing. Nothing good or bad. This is one empty piece of ocean you raised us in."

"Alright, I'm gonna check sonar. Maybe someone's listening who just isn't interested in responding."

She slid back down the ladder and at the sonar station lifted the headphones over her ears. She didn't bother sitting, but stood turning the control wheel with one hand, slowly back and forth, scanning for the sound of anything made by humans. One nice thing about being dead in the water was they weren't making any noise themselves. She could hear even the small waves against the hull of the _Prospect_. It was a rare pleasure to have such clean and uncompromised sound. But for all that silence, there wasn't much to hear.

Except... way off their rear port side. A very soft throbbing. It was faint and threaded, like the last heartbeats of a leviathan.

She called Hemi over. "Listen to this, and tell me what it is."

Hemi had excellent ears for sonar. He put the headphones on and closed his eyes.

"Small surface craft... unusual though. It seems like it has almost no hull sound. I don't really hear any wake running along it."

"Can you calculate a range?"

"Ya, it's close. Let's see." He looked at the dials of the sonar unit and scribbled some numbers on a scrap paper. "2 nautical miles, thereabouts maybe? I think you should be able to see them with the scope."

Percy nodded and climbed back up into the control compartment. She raised the periscope up and spun it around to the bearing of the target. She scanned slowly back and forth along the horizon line, where the dark gray of the water press-fit up against the light gray of the sky. With the _Prospect_ on the surface, and the scope up, she could see something like ten nautical miles on a clear day. This was as good as vision ever got on a submarine.

"Even if it were a fucking canoe... at two miles away I should be able to see it." There was nothing but unblemished gray fields in her scope. She double-checked the bearing with Hemi. She was pointed in the right direction, there was simply nothing there. 

She had a hunch though. She felt confident about the sonar target. She was sure something was there despite the fact that underwater sound can sometimes play tricks. The lack of any visual on the surface narrowed down the possibilities of what it could be.

"Hemi, I want to motor over closer to it."

"What ever it is, it's fucking small. Even if we find something, and even if they are friendly, there might not be much the can do to help us."

"Taking fucking risks has got us this far, Hem. Stay here on sonar and track it."

Captain Percy put Bastian back in the control seat. She gave him a heading towards the sonar target and they put the electric motors in gear. Her eyes locked on the battery gauge, which waved slightly as the motors started turning, drawing amperage out of there depleted battery banks. The needles on the battery gauges were already in the red. There was such a very little gap of air between them and the zero mark. They would only get one shot at this. 


### Ship-to-ship

They were creeping --- two nautical miles an hour. Going very slow would preserve the battery power longer. After a quarter hour or so, Hemi called up from sonar, "We got lucky Percy, I'm tracking something like an intercept course. At this rate there's no way we would ever have caught them, if they were heading away from us. But..." There was a gap, and Percy could hear him scratching a pencil on paper. "But, we need to go slightly faster, can you do four knots?"

Percy sighed. It didn't sound like much, but it was twice as much power consumption. "You heard the man Bastian, give her a little gas."

There was a burning cigarette between Bastian's bony fingers as they wrapped around the throttle and eased it slightly forward.

Ten minutes later Hemi called up, "That's good. We'll be within a quarter mile of it in a few minutes."

"They must be able to see us. They haven't changed direction or speed?"

"Nope. They must not be looking, or they just don't care."

Captain Percy stayed on the periscope, scanning slowly back and forth across the bearing. Still nothing.

"Shit!" Called up Hemi. "They're gone. No more sound."

"Stop the boat Bastian." The electric motors were very quiet when running this slow, but she wanted Hemi to have total silence for listening. "What was the last range?"

"About 500 meters. They're super close. We could ping them?"

"Ah, that would fucking scare the shit out of them. They might think we were armed and about to fire on them. We're trying to make friends here. ...I'm going to try ship-to-ship radio, we're just close enough they might hear us, and that might be a little less threatening."

Percy reached over her head and flipped on the ship-to-ship radio. It wasn't really a radio, it was just acted like one. It used the sonar rig to push sound through the water to talk to other ships nearby. 500 meters was just about the limit of its range. Real radio transmissions were supposed to follow a set of protocols and rules, potentially enforced by Authorities in their territories. Ship-to-ship had no rules other than an informal argot that had developed partially to obfuscate meaning for any other ship that might be listening, and partially just out of habit.

Captain Percy took down the mic from the radio and brought it to her mouth. She pushed the transmit button, and the needles on the gauges on the radio jumped to show how much power she was transmitting with. She whistled a series of five tones into the mic, and let go of the transmit button. The power needles died back to zero, and there was silence for a minute or two. Then she repeated the transmission of the tones. Another minute passed.

Then a crackly male voice came over the radio. "I see you over there, you hulking ugly gray submarine. And I guess you know I'm here. Why are ya sittin' on the fuckin surface, and what the fuck ya want with me?"

Percy hesitated, and then transmitted back. "Well, first let me say we're nothing but a transport sub, and we're unarmed. Second, we've been severely damaged, and walked through an icy hell to get back to the surface. We're out of fuel and extremely low on power. Long and short is that we're in some desperate need of help, and you are the only contact we've seen in these empty waters."

Another moment passed. "Yea. Well. These waters are empty because the Authorities running this territory right now are a bunch of tight-sphinctered aholes who seem more interested in shooting down transports than letting any commerce commence. It's a bad place to be not moving on the surface."

"Not movin' is hardly fuckin' typical for us. What cha got there? Any assistance you can offer would be much appreciated."

"Ehh, I'm not one who much for offering assistance, but if yer telling the truth, your sitch seems pretty dire."

"I know that's kinda a risk for you to take. Anything I can do to reassure you we aren't anything other than we say we are?"

"The territorial Authority motherfuckers around here generally just shoot first, check papers later. They're not much for mind games. So I think I can risk pulling alongside ya, and poppin' the hatch. Don't send nobody onto my boat without my sayso, or I'll dive straight out from under ya, got it?"

"Alrighty, we'll look for ya off the port side. Out."


### Shakes pulls alongside

"Hemi," Percy called down to sonar, "we've got ourselves something, though I'm not sure what. You and Bastian come up on deck with me."

Bastian unfolded his long skinny limbs from the control chair and climbed up the ladder and up through the sail hatch with Percy and Hemi following. The wind was blowing a little harder now and the chop had kicked up a bit. Bastian cupped his hands and lit another cigarette. Percy and Hemi shaded their eyes, scanning the water. It was a few minutes before they saw a small gray oblong object cutting through the choppy little waves. It was a tiny submarine sail, no more than a meter long and high, with a couple of thin whispy antennas trailing from the top in the wind. Unusual for a submarine sail, it had a small view port in the front of it through which the pilot could look. At the rear of the sail a thin stream of diesel smoke floated up and away behind it. The deck of the small sub was totally awash, running just at the surface of the water.

As it got closer they could see the big splotchy patches of rust all along the hull of the mini-sub, and a slight oil slick of a trail that it left behind in its very minimal wake. Bastian, Hemi, and Percy climbed over the fairing of the sail of the _Prospect_ and down to the deck. Standing here, Percy was discomforted to see the bow of her boat sitting much lower in the water than usual, still weighted down by the tons of excess ballast water.

A hatch opened at the top of the sail of the mini-sub and a head of a man with spiked yellow hair emerged. His arms were still below inside the sail working controls and he was standing propped on something so he could see as he guided the boat alongside the _Prospect_. Bastian opened a wet-storage hatch on the deck and pulled out some large white rubber bumpers, each with a long line that he tied off on cleats welded to the deck and lowered down between the two subs.

"Toss a line!" The guy in the sail said as he let the engine run on idle and climbed up over the fairing. He was wearing rubbers boots as he ran up along the washed deck. They were pulled over black leather pants that were cracked and gray at the seams and joints. From the left side of his ancient brown leather belt hung a couple of sizes of adjustable wrenches, the finish on the them beat away from years of use and banging into each other on his belt, like chimes, so they were matte in color and rusting in places. He wore a worn black denim vest from which the sleeved had been inexpertly removed, leaving stray threads of denim.

Bastian, still with a cigarette between his lips, threw across a line and made it fast to a recessed cleat in the hull of the mini-sub, and then repeated the move at the stern. He nimbly leaped across to the hand-holds on the side of the _Prospect_ and climbed up the curving side to the deck.


### Intro Shakes

He looked around with some nervous twitching, and then motioned to Bastian for a cigarette, who cupped his hand and lit it off his own before handing it to the man.

The man took the cigarette in a hand that shook slightly when he reached out, and brought it to his lips and sucked long and hard at it. "Ah fuck thanks. I ran out a couple of days ago. I go by Shakes." He held up his hand in front of them and they could see it tremble slightly in the air. "Ya can see why."

"That's a hell of a craft ya got there Shakes." Said Hemi.

"Like it? I built it my fuckin self. Welded it together on the top of a mountain from scraps. On a coffee farm, they had a bunch of land higher up where the coffee don't grow, and it seemed like a good place to build a boat. It was. Cept it wasn't a good place to launch a boat from. Getting it down to the water was more difficult than the buildin'."

"I've heard of this kind of thing," said Percy, "run fast and just below the surface. Basically invisible to any kind of radar, and too quiet for most sonar. Good for... small shipments?"

"Ay, 'Specialty shipments' --- when stuff has to be got somewhere fast with no questions asked. Just not too much stuff. I alsa have a few special modifications, this here ship is best in class!" Hemi looked doubtfully at the rusting bulbous hulk alongside. "Most of these kinds of homemade jobs just run at the surface, I added some batteries and some trim tanks, and this here boat, the _Gnat_ is the name, can _dive_. Run a bit under water, just enough to get away from any curious Authorities."

"How deep?" Asked Hemi.

"Maybe 30 meters on a good day. You don't have to go very deep to hide in something so small."

"How fast?" Hemi's curiosity was peaked now.

Shakes grinned. "Faster than this tub." He said kicking the toe of his rubber boot against the hull of the _Prospect_. 

Percy frowned. "That's pretty impressive there, but have any of you got any ideas how this is going to help get my boat moving? You ain't carrying a load of diesel fuel are ya Mr. Shakes?"

"Can't say as I am. And I can't say what I _am_ carrying, ceptin that I can't see how any of it could help you. Still, if I can do anything to help, I'm game. I'm pretty convinced y'all ain't some Authority ruse, and we smugglers gotta stick together I say."

"We're not smugglers." Said Percy, her eye firmly locked on Shakes'. "We're independent logistics operators."

"Ain't we all!" Said Shakes. "Honestly, I ain't got much in the way of ideas for ya. I was thinking maybe you was the smart ones. From what I can see y'all are fuckin' fucked. Best I can say is I could run into where I'm headin' and send some friendly bigger boat back out for ya. But that'll probably take a couple of days."


### they find out about the depot from Shakes

"In a couple of days we'll either be sunk or in an Authority holding cell. There's gotta be a better option. Hemi?"

"Well, nothing immediately comes to mind. But that's with limited information. If we have a new option, it will be aboard the _Gnat_, but to sort that out, I'll have to get in there and take a look at what resources you've got Shakes. I'm not sure how willing ya are to let me do that."

Shakes didn't say anything, but pulled on his cigarette and watched the exhaled smoke quickly pulled out over the water by the breeze.

"Mind if we ask where yer headed Shakes?" Asked Percy

"Ay, I was about to fuckin say anyway: there's a mid-sea depot about 100 miles from here. It's just over the line in the waters of a different Authority, somewhat more permissive, bit more friendly to commerce. That's why the Authority on this side of the line are such a bunch of aggressive motherfuckin' assholes though --- they don't want shit running through here to there. If you can get this tub of yers to the depot, you can definitely get fuel there, and probably some poorly executed and overpriced repairs as well."

"Sounds like a goddamn Eden." Said Percy. "Look, we aren't the type to ask for help, and I hate imposin' on other fuckin' folks business, just as I don't want 'em imposing on mine. But you can see we're more than a little desperate here. If you can allow Hemi --- and just Hemi --- aboard to take some specs of your boat, see if you're carrying anything he can use, we'll make it up to you at the depot. ...though honestly at the moment about all we can offer you is hot food."

Shakes eyes brightened at that. "Hrm. Well I ain't been eating nothing but cold chow straight from the can for days now. A hot meal is a strong offer yer puttin on the fuckin' table there. Alright. This big guy, and this big guy alone. And he don't look at nothing I don't want him to look at, and he don't get answers to no questions I don't want to answer. No pushin, right?"

"No pushing." Said Hemi.

"Right. Hang back a minute, let me go look around in there first, make sure all my pornography is put away."

Percy grinned as Shakes lowered himself down the side and leapt nimbly over the dangerous gap between the two boats. He disappeared into the sail hatch of the _Gnat_.

"Interesting character." Said Hemi.

"Solo operators... nobody who is happy spending days or weeks at sea alone --- eating cold canned food no less --- ever totally has their head screwed on fucking right. Anyway, it doesn't fucking matter how pleasant a person he is. The question is, is there _anything_ you can do with that boat that's going to help us?"

"I'm not entirely hopeful. It's not much of a craft, and is not likely to have much in the way of resources aboard. "

"Find us something Hemi. And don't do anything to set off that tweaked motherfucker while you're over there though."

"I shall be a lamb among the lions."

From the sail of the _Gnat_ Shakes' head and arm popped up and gestured. "Come on over man-mountain. Mind the gap!"

Hemi was just as nimble at hopping the gap as Shakes has been, but it was a more interesting move to watch because of his great size. Hemi was wearing regular boots and the water washing the deck of the _Gnat_ was wetting the lower part of his legs. He stepped up and over in the open hatch in the sail, and from where Percy was watching, it seemed for a moment like there was no way that huge man was getting into that tiny hatch. But Hemi disappeared into the boat just as quickly as Shakes did.

Percy gave Bastian a pull on the sleeve, and he tossed a smoked-out butt into the ocean before they climbed up the sail to head back inside the _Prospect_.


### On board the _Gnat_

"So what do you think?" Asked Shakes. "Ain't it the finest boat ye ever had the pleasure of pushing inside of?" Shakes seemed genuinely proud.

"It's certainly a masterpiece of the genre." Even more evenly than usual.

Hemi had spent nearly his entire life among and inside filthy machines, but he had never seen anything as grimey as this. There was literal garbage all over the floor: empty cans rolling back back and forth with the swell, candy wrappers, an ashtray that seemed like it hadn't been used for ash, but merely as a target to toss used butts at, most of which had missed and were on the deck. 

There were stacks of pornography --- Shakes had not bothered to hide any of it, or at least Hemi hoped that was true, because the stacks that were out were of such foul stuff that Hemi could not imagine what Shakes would have deigned feel needed to be hidden.

In one space recessed between the supports of the pressure hull were stacks of greasy cans still unopened. The labels had been peeled off and the contents written on them in grease pencil. Most appeared to be of some variety of highly-salted pasta-and-sauce. In another recess was a bin with what must have been a hundred different types of puzzle games with squares of color to sort --- all solved. 

The controls to the sub were aligned with and partially inside of the sail. The sail was the only place with enough headroom to stand upright. Or, at least Shakes could stand upright in the sail, Hemi still had to crouch a bit. There were small wooden crates crammed into the bow section, and more behind the controls in about the middle of the boat. Shakes had thrown what were clearly his sleeping blankets over the crates. There was still a thin heavily-stained mattress to one side, which Shakes was raising to lean against the pressure hull so they could get past the crates.

"Y'all woke me from a nap with the ship-to-ship call. That's why I didn't see ya earlier. I suppose you want to see the engines and batteries and whatnot? They're towards the back." Shakes pick up a brown bag from the deck that had some weight holding it upright, and extracted a piece of hard candy that he started sucking on.

"Yes, the engines first if you please." Hemi squeezed past the crates and pulled a small notebook and pencil from an inside pocket of his tweed jacket. The engine was massive and took up the entire rear third of the boat. Now Hemi was genuinely impressed. "That's a lot of engine for such a small boat."

"Took the fuckin' thing out of a tractor that had been broken down in a field for years on the coffee farm. Had to build a gantry and borrow another tractor to haul it up the mountain to where I was building the _Gnat_ and get it installed. Direct-drive to the prop, none of that electric-motor shit."

Hemi could see that, the grease-covered steel drive shaft came straight out the back end of the diesel along the center-line of the boat and out through the stern, like an egg on its side, pierced by a needle.

"But you said it's got batteries too, the boat can swim underwater?"

"Ya, the direct-shaft--drive means I've gotta have a transmission of course, and I worked with a mechanical genius on the coffee farm to build this fancy-ass transmission that I can switch over to that electric motor to drive.  It's a fucking grind though, I try to avoid it, except in emergencies. I have to come back here switch out the diesel and manually engage the electric motor with these levers. And the electric motor is small --- it's pretty slow, though silent as a submerged graveyard."

"It is the finest piece of mountain-top engineering I've ever seen on the sea." Said Hemi. 

Shakes grinned.

"And the batteries?"

"Batteries, fuel, ballast tanks are all below these floor panels. You have to pull them up to get at them. Since I rarely use the electric motor, the batteries almost always have a full charge on them, as they do right now, if that helps somehow. Obviously not enough to power your giant tub over there."

"No, not nearly. How much fuel do you have?"

"Maybe twelve hours worth left. Enough to get me to the depot."

Hemi scribbled some calculations. "How much standard horse power does that engine have exactly? No, actually, how much horse power does your electric motor have?"

"Fuck if I know. Hang on, I have a manual around here somewhere." Shakes pulled open a small steel door of a cabinet mounted on the wall and handed Hemi a manual covered with black finger prints and gray-stained pages. While Hemi flipped through it and jotted in his little notebook, Shakes took a comb from his pocket and dipped it in a bucket half-filled with oil dripping from the diesel engine and ran it through his hair, then teased it back up to a spiky randomness with the tips of his fingers. He wiped his fingers on his shirt.

Hemi looked at him through the small frames of his glasses, but didn't say anything.

"Alright, I need to go back to the _Prospect_ and sit down with my numbers. And I want to look at the charts with you so you can show me where this depot is. Can I borrow this manual? And do you have one for the diesel too?"

"Ya here." Said Shakes, handing Hemi an even fatter manual that was stained far more heavily, and had a couple of thick black lines along the ends of the pages of the sections most heavily used.

They climbed out of the _Gnat_ hopped back across to the _Prospect_, up and into the sail and down the navigation station.

"OK, where's this depot Shakes?"

Shakes pulled down the magnifier and scanned across the chart. "Wait, where are we now?" Hemi pointed to the obvious small x at the end of a string of grease pencil dashes. "Let's see.." Shakes tapped his wavering finger against the glass covering the chart, and rotated the magnified around in slow circles. "Ah, here!" Shakes said pointing to a small island marked on the map and labeled only "deserted."

"That's your major trade center?" Asked Hemi. "A deserted island?"

"Well, 'major' might be a bit descriptive." Said Shakes. "But look." He took the grease pencil and drew a lightweight but long line across the ocean. "The Territorial Authority boundary is about here. With total assholes on this side, and sort-of assholes on the other. So you can see how it makes sense to put a depot there to help facilitate trade in, out, and through assolevania here.

"That's true." Said Hemi, taking a pair of calipers and measuring the distance from their current position to the deserted island.  "I hope you're right about there being a depot there. There's no way we'll make it any further than that."

"It'll be there!" 

"By the smell of it, there's probably some food ready by now." Said Hemi. 

"Shit yeah. I'm starved!"


### A meal aboard the Prospect

Hemi and Shakes came into the galley of the _Prospect_ with Captain Percy and Bastian already there, crammed into the tight seating around the table. Gregory was working a giant cast iron pan at the stove, that was so heavy with frying rice that he struggled to shake it with one hand, a gesture he felt was necessary to keep the rice moving and frying evenly.

Gregory looked up when Hemi and Shakes came in. Hemi introduced Shakes.

"Fuck yeah," said Shakes eyeing the pile of frying rice. "I ain't eaten nothing but cold canned pasta for a week."

"None of your canned garbage food here, Shakes." Said Gregory, grinding the pan back and forth across the blazing red element of the electric range. "This is real submariner's food. Everything good that can't go bad. Rice, eggs, cabbage..."

"Are you putting that foul slimy-gray pickled cabbage in the rice Gregory?" Asked Bastian. "You'll kill a submariner if submariner's food is that real."

Gregory huffed. "My ol' pap worked a galley in a submarine in the wars. He used to say 'if you can heat it, you can eat it.' And this shit's gonna be plenty hot." Gregory dumped in an entire container of the questionable pickled cabbage, and stirred it around as the sound of frying drowned out any conversation. He only stirred it for a few minutes. "Shakes, for helping us out, you're up first." Gregory cracked an egg onto an already heating smaller frying pan next to the giant one full of rice. As it sizzled on the slick black surface, Gregory dumped huge piles into a big bowl and handed it to Gregory. The rice was browned by the black salty sauces Gregory had poured into it, and steaming bits of cabbage slithered through it. It was flecked with red and black pepper, and in a few places crusty black and somewhat burnt. Shakes was about to dig a fork in when Gregory slipped the fried egg on top with a spatula, it's white stained an oily, slightly gray color, and the glowing orange yolk a wiggling skin with hot liquid still inside.

Shakes grinned before plunging the tines of his fork into the yolk and letting it run into his rice. He then started working his way into his bowl with uninterrupted motion of his fork from the bowl to his mouth.

Gregory served up the rest of the crew the same way. Captain Percy asked him to run up to the control room and get on the PA and tell Chips and Owen to come up for some grub.

Hemi sat at the end of the table with Shakes electric motor manual open in front of him, eating his rice with one hand while scribbling down notes in the other.

Their hunger got the better of any conversation for a few minutes as they shoveled mounds of rice, egg, and cabbage into their mouths. Gregory returned and served himself, and then got up a few minutes later to fry two more eggs for Chips and Owen when they arrived, and few minutes later had to get up to make Shakes another egg. All told, every one of them had at least two servings and Chips and Shakes each ate three servings apiece. Gregory never got to sit for more than a minute, and when no more eggs were being demanded, he got up again to put coffee on.


### A plan

Chips and Owen took their coffees to go, and headed back down to try and keep reinforcing Chips' patch. When the rest of them finally all had a cup of coffee in front of them, and the empty bowls pushed into the middle of the table, Hemi put his pencil down. 

"Maybe some of you are familiar with the Angler fish?" Hemi asked. "In some species the female is enormous compared to the male, maybe like a hundred times bigger. The females are complex, highly evolved organisms, with sophisticated traps for catching and devouring other fish. The males are nothing but tiny sperm repositories. They swim around until they find a female, attach themselves to the female's underside, and then fuse with her body, essentially becoming a sperm organ for her."

"Hemi, let's try stepping around the metaphor and getting to the point." Said Captain Percy.

"Here's what I propose," continued Hemi, "The _Prospect_ has a hatch with a mating collar on the bottom side of the boat. Normally we use that for underwater docking in situations where we need to dock on someone's topside hatch. We could rig something so we could mate the _Gnat_ to the underside of the _Prospect_, and then feed up fuel and power into the _Prospect_ from the _Gnat_. Kinda like a male anglerfish..."

"Got it." Percy interrupted. "And you think there's enough juice left in the _Gnat_ to take us both to the depot like that?"

"We have to cut everything to the bone, but the math says we could make it. _Could_."

"And what the fuck do I get from your biology lesson?" Asked Shakes. "This plan is really me casting my lot in with you losers. Basically I'm donating all my fuel to you and hoping I can piggyback in, right?"

"We can pay you for the fuel Shakes." Said Percy.

"Plus we'll be fitting a nice mating collar onto the _Gnat_, you might find some use for that in the future." Said Hemi.

"And hot meals for til we get to the depot. I got a propane stove stowed somewhere, so we don't have to waste any more precious electricity on cooking."

Shakes, perhaps more driven by his stomach than he cared to admit, considered. "I want double the value of the fuel."

"Done." Said Percy.

"And you're buying a dinner of _good_ food at the depot."

"Absolutely." Said Percy.

"And... I want you to keep a line open to me on any future job possibilities."

"What.. like partners?" Bristled Percy.

"Fuck no. I work alone. But a man has to have a network in this game. I want you to be a big node on my network."

"Alright. Any job that seems suitable for a specialty cargo hauler like yourself, I will send your way."

Shakes grinned. Now they were working in a space he understood. The most profit came from future options. "So Hemi, what exactly are you going to do to my beautiful boat?"


### They talk Chips about fitting mating collar to the Gnat

Hemi led Shakes up to the control room, and Hemi got on the PA to ask Chips to join him there. She arrived a few minutes later, cursing. Her boots were dripping, showing how much water was still in the cargo bay.

"Motherfeckers, I am feckin' trying to keep this feckin boat from sinking. What the feck do you need me fer that's more impertent than tha'?"

"We need to weld a mating collar onto the sail of Shake's boat, the _Gnat_. It has to fit to the _Prospect's_ bottom mating collar. I want to attach the _Gnat_ to the underside, and run with it like that. Think you could rig something like that up?" Hemi asked.

"Weel feck. I might have some spare steel that could do that. Depends on what the hatch on that ther boat looks like, so I'll have to eyeball that. Possible it could be done. But tha's a feckin' tricky bit of sonar listenin' to mate to that, steerin' the boat up from underneath like. Can ye do that?"

"The _Gnat_ has a view port in the sail. He should be able to see where he is to do the mating maneuver without sonar." Said Hemi.

"A feckin' window on a submarine. Feckin crazy shit ya want to pull here. But look, I need to keep workin' on my patch in the cargo bay, I may spend the rest of my lif' workin' on that feckin patch, really. Who's going t' do that feckin' wet welding job? Owen has been gettin' the hang of it..."

"The kid?" Asked Shakes, "Fuck that. If there's welding to be done, I'll weld my own fucking boat."

"She's right anyway." Said Hemi. "The patch in the _Prospect_ needs more work. If it fails, it could take both boats down. Before you go back to your patch though Chips, get Owen and go out with Shakes and take a look at the _Gnat_. Make sure he has what he needs to get this done right. Have Owen haul up the spare welding rig." 

"Ay Hem." She said, understanding that what Hemi really meant was to tell Shakes how to do it right. She got on the PA and asked Owen to meet her outside, and then followed Shakes up through the hatch in the sail.

Hemi climded down out of the control room and found Percy sitting at the sonar station with the headset on, listening. When she saw Hemi, she pulled one earpiece off. "That go OK?"

"Yeah, Shakes says he is going to do the weld, Chips wants to keep working on the patch."

"That makes sense. What's next?"

"I just wanted to look at the chart and run my numbers again."

"That makes sense too. We should put someone on radar, I don't want any Authority craft sneaking up on us."

"Put Gregory or Bastian on it." 

"Yea. Alright, I'll get Bastian in here. Better than nobody."

"Send Gregory out to help Owen and Shakes. That's going to be a bit of a tricky operation."

"Good idea." Captain Percy headed to the galley to rouse the guys from their cold and empty coffee cups.


### Back on deck, with the cargo bay hatch open, lifting the welding rig and welding the Gnat mating collar

On the deck of the _Prospect_ Owen had the huge cargo hatch open. It was the only way to get a heavy welding rig out of the boat. He had assembled a tripod gantry over the open hole down into the cargo bay, from which was hanging a heavy block with a chain running through it. Gregory was down in the cargo hold hooking the end of the chain to a welding rig. When it was secure Gregory gave Owen the thumbs up.

"Hey Gregory," Owen called down to him, "while I'm hauling the welding rig up look around: we still need the material for the mating collar, the gangway so I can wheel this fucking thing across to the _Gnat_, heavy clamps, and a welding mask." Owen looked across at the deck of the _Gnat_ with the chop washing over it. "Uh, better get those rubber waders too." He lit a cigarette and started hauling the welding rig up, hand-over-hand. "This isn't going to be fucking easy." He said to himself through the cigarette handing from his lips.

When he got the welding rig suspended over the deck, he gave it a little kick, and when it swung back he let the chain out and grabbed the rig as it touched the deck and tilted back toward the hole. This was really a two-person job, a mistake would mean a 10 meter drop into the cargo bay. But what was he going to do? Chips and Shakes were over on the deck of the _Gnat_ drawing lines on the top of the sail with a grease pencil.

Owen wheeled the weldling rig out of the way and laid it down on the deck of the _Prospect_ so it wouldn't tilt off into the ocean. By the time he got back over the big open hatch, Gregory was back underneath with the gangway, and lashed to the railings of it the various other things Owen had asked for. Owen dropped the end of the chain down to him, and Gregory secured it to one end of the gangway. "Hold on, I'll come up and help you haul it up." And he disappeared.

With Gregory on deck they pulled the gangway up vertically to the deck, pulled it out onto the deck and got it lashed into place connecting the deck of the _Prospect_ to the wet deck of the _Gnat_.


### They plan the mating collar

Chips waved Owen over. "Thankyee for tha', be a lot'n easier gettin back to the _Prospec'_ now I 'spect." She grinned her rarely-seen wide-mouthed grin at Owen. "Alright, look 'ere, this is the plan Shakes and I get worked out, and ye should be glad Shakes is doin' it. Going to be a feckin' nightm're if'n it works, and a feckin squirtin' trip to the head if it don't." She pointed to the top of the sail. "We feckin' lecked out though, Shakes 'ere made the sail fat enough that we can make the feckin' welds flat. Ye just need a piece of steel cylinder cut even, then weld it around the 'atch openin', and then weld t'e spare male feckin' docking clamps we got ont'e t'e sides of t'e cylinder."

"How're you going to activate the docking clamps? They're electro-magnetic."

"Yeah," said Shakes, "we'll need to drill some through-hull fittings. That sucks, but it shouldn't be too hard to make them water-tight to 30 meters, which is what I usually call the depth limit of the _Gnat_."

"Since we're going to be dragging the _Gnat_ along by the mating collar," said Owen, "Seems like ya should also weld some supports on the outside of the collar, down the sail, and directly to the structural elements of the hull. It'll be ugly as fuck, but less likely to leave the _Gnat_ ripped away from the collar." 

"Ugly-as-fuck is my other name." Said Shakes.

"Listen to the kid, Shakes. He's gettin a touch for this stuff." Said Chips.

"Hey, offer all the advice you want, but I'm the one who puts the torch to my boat, ya?"

"Good by feckin' me. I'll leave ya stupid feckers too it. I got me own weldin' to do." Said Chips and headed back up the gangway to the _Prospect_.

"We'll need some other pieces to make this work, I'll get Gregory digging them up." Said Owen.


### They weld the mating collar

This was going to be an extremely tough job. Not as tough as welding the pressure hull back together under water, Owen reminded himself, but nobody would do this job if they didn't have to. Owen had wheeled the welding rig across the gangway, and that  had only been modestly harrowing. Lashing it to the sloshing hull of the _Gnat_ had been somewhat more so. Owen set Shakes up with everything he needed, like a nurse handing a surgeon tools.

The ocean chop wasn't horrendous, but it was enough that the _Gnat_ rolled back and forth under them. Owen had locked huge clamps in place that held the work material to the sail. The water washing over the deck would sometimes smack up against the sail and shoot up right where Shakes would be welding.

Shakes stood astride his boat at precisely sea-level in the same way one might stand on a mountain top. He lit a cigarette, and put it to his lips. He put the mask on his head, and slipped the heavy welding gloves on his hands. He picked up the torch, and standing straight up, opened his arms wide and closed his eyes. He took long slow breathes, gapping his lips next to his cigarette. He cleared his mind, focussed on his breathing. He felt the swell and rhythm of the ocean, marked out by the adjustable wrenches tapping against his leg. He called the gods of steady hands and perfect welds to him.

He opened his eyes, lit the torch off his cigarette, leaned over and flipped the welding mask down, and proceeded to lay down the foulest globbing booger weld Owen had ever seen.

"Jesus fucking Christ." Said Owen quietly.

Shakes welded, went back over his work, welded more. It grew uglier and uglier, globs upon globs of congealed molten metal. The wash soaked them in cold water. Shakes had to constantly stop welding so Owen could move the clamps. Since the seam needed to be watertight, Owen wanted to keep it press-fit in place with the clamps the whole time. Owen knew that that starting and stopping like that was bad for a welder who wanted to make a clean, strong weld. But since Shake's welds were about the worst he'd ever seen, that seemed like the least of his problems. The hot welds steamed when the water ran over them, which Owen was pretty sure would not contribute the strength of the weld.

"You... built this boat?" Owen asked Shakes, when he raised his head up for a break. 

"Ay ya. On a mountain top."

"And... no leaks or anything?"

"Ah well, ye know there's always gonna be 'nother leak. I just patch em and keep movin'."

"Lot of patches?"

"Sometimes it seems like it's more patch than original boat. But then, since the boat was built from scraps, it has always been a quilty kinda thing."

By the time they finished welding the support struts down the side of the hull, it looked like a bipedal birthday cake, frosted by a toddler using a mixture of coke and pitch. 

"You think that'll hold?" Owen asked looking at the mess doubtfully.

"Ah hell's ya. Look at how much material we welded into that thing! See an engineer can build things to an exact fuckin' spec and if they're good it will perform in all the situations they expect it to. The thing is, that don't mean it will perform in situations the engineer _don't_ expect. That's why I always _overbuild_ things. So I'll be ready for what I doesn't expect."

Owen wheedled his way up and down following the thread of that logic, and eventually decided it made absolute sense. "Well, nothing like holding it underwater and dragging it the fuck along at a few fuckin knots to test your welding work."

"Ay that's fer fuckin' sure. Why don't ya go tell Hemi we're ready here."


### They lower the boat

Getting all the gear from the welding operation stowed back in the cargo hold took longer than expected. The chop was building a bit, and that made anything aboard the _Gnat_ difficult to do. Once Hemi saw everything lowered back below, and checked the main cargo hatch seal, he went to look for Captain Percy. He found her down in the cargo hold, watching Chips weld yet more scraps of metal patches over the still-leaking wound in the pressure hull, though thankfully the water level was at least down enough that Chips was wading it it instead of swimming in it.

"Cap, we're ready to fuckin' try this connecting up the _Gnat_ shit."

"Fuck good." Said Percy, through an exhale of her cigarillo smoke. Her eyes were bloodshot and her entire face drooping and wane from lack of sleep. She had another cup of coffee in her other hand. "Need any else the fuck from me when you try the fucking mating?"

"Fuck, I don't think so. But I think it will go easier a lot fucking easier for Shakes if we can put the _Prospect_ in motion, and lower the deck under, just go sail-fuckin-up. The waves will have a lot less affect on the motion of the boat like that." This caused Chips to look up from her work.

"Do we have the fuckin' battery life left for that shit?"

"Ten minutes at a fuckin creep speed? I think we can just fuckin' manage it. I'm more worried about whether we have enough fuckin' control over the buoyancy to take her down like that."

"What the fuck d'ya think Chips?

"Feck! Sounds lik' some stupid ass rutting shit to me. Why th' fuck risk it?" Asked Chips.

"If we can run sail-fuckin-up, we'll be a much harder to spot fuckin' target as we head for the fuckin' depot. Might be a dumb fuckin thing to try, but we'll be better off if it fuckin' works, so we might as well give the shit a try right fuckin' now." Said Hemi.

"He's Right Chips."

"Ah feck ya both, ya weeping cunts. Yer det'rmined to sink us. Ya forgettin' the high pressure system's depleted? I dun't think we got enough left for a full blow if something goes wrong. Feck if there's enough power to bring her back to the surf'ce with the feckin low-pressure system! We'll be lucky t' feckin be leapin' out the top of th' sail as it lowers away unter us."

"I agree, Chips, it's fuckin dangerous. But so is running slow with engines blaring full-up on the surface. We're a big fat fuckin' radar _and_ sonar target. We need the stealth and lowering her the fuck down will give us."

"Ay well, if yer both feckin' suicidal, and murder-fecking-cidal --- seein' as I dont feckin' go along with this feckin' shits --- this fucking main wound in the pressure hull is leaking slow now, and looks like the feckin ting will 'old fer a bit. And ye know if ye open the main ballast valves, the boat will go down. Ya better hope them feckin valves close again though."

"There's no reason to think they won't." Said Percy. "and you'll go double-check those fucking things our lives depend on before we try this incredibly fuckin risky operation."

"The feckin' problem," Said Chips, exasperated, "is there's no fecking back-up plan --- no failsafe, no redundantcy. The boat werks perfect like, or we all feckin' die. Submarinin' is jes too feckin dangerous with no backup-system. More than one, 'n fact."

"Not fuckin disputing that Chips. But sinking is only one risk we face right now. Go check the ballast tank valves. When you're happy with them, tell Hemi, and lets put her deck underwater."


### Explaining the mating procedure

Ten minutes later Chips reported to the control room that the main ballast valves were working as expected. Hemi checked over the state of their batteries and other systems, and noted everything on a clipboard. He got on the external PA and called Shakes to the control room.

Two minutes later Shakes' head was at the hatch above Hemi in the sail and he was calling down.

"Ya fuckin' ready Hemi?"

"Just fuckin' about. I need you to take the _Gnat_ off a hundred meters or so. We're going to fucking bring the _Prospect_ down to just sail-out, and creep at two knots. We'll hold it steady. Then it's all you: dive the _Gnat_, come up underneath, you should see the mating collar just about under where the sail would be on the bottom --- about one-third of the way forward from the stern. Bring the _Gnat_ up under, fuckin' _gently_ lay your mating collar over ours, and if you fuckheads didn't mess up the location of the docking clamps too much, you should be able to lock into the hull of the _Prospect_... like a fuckin male angler fish."

Shakes gave him the finger.

"When you are clamped on, bang on your hatch with one of those wrenches of yours. I'll have Gregory down there waiting to hear from you. Don't fucking open the hatch til Gregory bangs back, ok? Even in its current condition, the _Prospect_ will do better if your fuckin welds leak than the _Gnat_ will. Keep in touch over the ship-to-ship."

Shake pounded his acknowledgement on the side of the sail, and his head disappeared from the hatch opening. It was still so quiet aboard the _Prospect_ with no engines and so few systems running that they could hear the _Gnat's_ Diesels fire up, and inarticulate shouts from Shakes to Gregory on the deck as Shakes cast off the lines and Gregory retrieved them and the bumpers.

"Hey-ut!" Shakes voice came crackling over the ship-to-ship. "I'm fired up, buttoned up, and off, motoring out."

Hemi pulled down the ship-to-ship mic. "Fuckin' got ya Shakes. Remember, _gentle_ is the word."

"I'm allllways fuckin gentle."

"We're going to take the _Prospect_ down to sail-out depth now. Hold tight til I give ya the fuckin' go."


### they dive to sail-out depth

Hemi got on the boat PA, and flipped the switch for both internal and external speakers. "Gregory, lock down all the external fuckin' hatches as you come back inside. Owen and Bastian, come up to the fuckin' control room, we're going to dive the boat to sail-out depth."

Moments later the entire crew converged on the control room. Gregory was climbing down from the sail, sealing the hatch above his head, Bastian and Owen were climbing up the ladder into the control room, and Chips joined Captain Percy at the navigation table just under the control room.

Captain Percy looked at Chips questioningly. "If'n we go down, I want to be here to say I told ye feckin' so." Said Chips.

"Chips, those are the 'bon voyage' words of every trip to hell." Replied Percy. "If you're gonna be up here, sit at radar and let us know if we're going to have a surprise fucking audience for this fucking operation." Captain Percy waited for Gregory to climb down from the control room, on his way to the bottom hatch on the lowest deck with his instructions from Hemi before she climbed up into the control room which was cramped up again with its full compliment of four people.

"OK, Bastian. Give us a 2 knot creep. We want just enough to keep us steady against the motion of the water." Bastian nudged the throttle forward, and they heard the soft hum of the electric motor as it put the propeller under torque. 
Hemi pulled at the ship-to-ship mic. "Shakes, we're going to try this shallow dive. If you see the sail disappear, this boat is never coming back up."

"Fucking Right." Shakes voice crackled. "I won't wait around for another meal then."

Hemi hung the mic back up. "OK, you know what they say: always do the stupidest fucking things on the stupidest little about of sleep. Owen, open the main ballast valves."

Owen swiveled to the tank control panel, and turned the small wheels that opened the valves.

"Just a fucking cunt hair of down angle on the dive plane." Said Hemi.

Owen was ready for this, his other hand still on the bigger wheel that controlled the dive planes. He inched it around it's circumference.

"As soon as you feel the angle on the boat Owen, level it back out again." By the time Hemi had said this, the _Prospect_ already had a slight angle down on the bow. A burst of air escaped up through the main ballast valves ahead of the sail as sea water pushed up into the ballast tanks from below and displaced the air out through the valves.

From the radar station below they could hear Chips muttering. "No feckin' redundant system..."

Owen already had the dive planes leveled out again and the slight angle came off the _Prospect's_ deck. Own and Hemi were watching the depth gauge closely as it slowly lifted up off it's pin. When it was firmly pointing at one meter of depth, Hemi reached over and closed the main ballast tank valves himself.

"Give it another minute... let's make sure everything is where it should be..." Said Hemi. But the boat held at a depth of one meter, the deck fully submerged, but most of the sail still sticking above the surface. Captain Percy reached up to pat Hemi's huge shoulder. In some ways it seemed like such a small thing, a basic maneuver they had done a thousand times before. But Chips was right, what was usually so routine was, in this case, incredibly risky. She felt a tremendous release of tension that she didn't know she had when the main ballast valves closed, everything working the way it was supposed to to.

"Good." Said Percy, satisfied. "We didn't sink her by flooding the main ballast, let's see if we can do it by opening a hole in the bottom onto a rusted bucket of a home-made boat."


### Mating the gnat to the prospect

Hemi got back on the ship-to-ship. "Shakes, we're holding at sail-out depth, two-knot forward creep. I think you can begin your dive now."

"Righto." Shakes replied.

Captain Percy raised the periscope and swiveled around until she could see the tiny, nearly-invisible gray sail of the _Gnat_ bobbing in the water off their port side. It picked up speed, and a little wake formed behind it. Then it shrank down and disappeared under the surface like a sun winking out at the horizon. She lowered the periscope back down.

"I'm gonna get on fuckin sonar." She said. 

Hemi nodded.

Percy slipped down the ladder and tapped Chips on the shoulder. "Ya better go join Gregory in the bottom of the fucking boat. Get a fucking welding rig... just in case."

"Ay, feckin redundant system! Now yer talkin'" Chips went off to the cargo bay to find her welding rig.

Captain Percy sat in the seat Chips vacated and glanced at the empty radar scope to make sure it was staying empty. She put the sonar headphones on, and turned the directional control until she could hear the quiet electric motor of the _Gnat_. Shakes was lining up directly behind the _Prospect_, slightly deeper and with more speed, coming up underneath them. She could follow his progress with a fair amount of precision through the sonar and it's range finder. But he moved into their wake where the sonar couldn't hear anything and disappeared for a minute. In another minute she should be able to hear the _Gnat_ directly underneath the _Prospect_.

On board the _Gnat_ shakes held his head down at a painful angle, trying to see exactly where he was in relation to the hulking leviathan slowly stirring the waters above him.

"Fuuuuuck. They should have mentioned that this would be stupidly fucking dangerous." Said Shakes to himself. "Like a backyard bully in a pool, holding some scrawny kid's head underwater... though I suppose some people must be into that sort of thing."

"Shakes," Hemi's voice came over the ship-to-ship with all the bass note stripped out of it. "Don't forget that since we're moving, you're going to have to give it a little umph when you get within a meter of the _Prospect_ or so. We're going slow enough that it shouldn't be too dramatic, but you also don't want to get sucked back into the _Prospect's_ propellers."

"Ay, fuck you all." He didn't bother to respond on the radio, his hands too busy with the controls of the _Gnat_. "Fuckin boat wasn't built for this shit. Handles like a goddamn beachball underwater."

He was pushing up slightly faster than the _Prospect_ from behind. He could just see the little black circle of the mating collar he was shooting for through his forward view port. He'd lose the ability to see it when he was close to it though. He squeezed the ballast blow handle and the _Gnat_ popped up an entire meter closer to the underside of the _Prospect_. "Ugh, too fuckin' much, too fast. _Gently_, gently..." He got within a meter of the hull of the _Prospect_ and lost sight of the mating collar just as he could feel the push of water from the moving hull of the _Prospect_ driving him backwards, and totally screwing up his sense of where he was until the mating collar came into view in front of him.

He gave the _Gnat_ a little more power to the electric motor, and moved forward through the streaming water, holding very close to the _Prospect_. The _Gnat_ inched slowly forward, the mating collar disappeared over his head again. He angled the small dive planes up a bit, and with a loud clang the mating collars of the two ships collided. Shake visualized what was happening in his head: the two mating collars were pressed against eachother, but not aligned. He slowly eased the controls, a little rudder port, a little rudder starboard, a little forward power, a little off the throttle. He was moving the mating collar around in a circle, trying to get it to slip into the _Prospect's_ collar. There was the sound of steel ring grinding on steel ring, until with another big clang, the whole boat popped upwards. 

It felt right. Shakes gave the tiniest squeese on the main ballast blow so that the _Gnat_ would have good strong upward bouyancy against the _Prospect_. He was pretty sure the two rings were mated, but the way to know for sure was the docking clamps. He flipped the exposed switch he and owen had installed, and with a little blue electric spark connected the circuit that ran up the heavy wires through the holes they had drilled in the sail to the mating clamps. He heard a third loud clang, and a green light next to the switch lit. If he had missed the docking collar, the clamps wouldn't have closed, so he was on. To be sure he disengaged the electric motor to let the prop spin freely. When he did so, he could feel the bow of the _Gnat_ bend down small amount in a sickening way, but the speed indicator didn't change. 

He picked up the ship-to-ship. "Hemi, I think I'm on."

"Ya, we can see the drag up here. We're going to trim our tanks to adjust for the _Gnat_ hanging on, and then shut down our engines. Otherwise we'll be dead in the water here in a matter of a few more minutes. Give a bang on that hatch and let's try opening it up."


### The hatch needs to be repaired

In the deepest part of the _Prospect_, a narrow hall between the forward and rear battery rooms that had heavy water-tight bulkhead doors on either side, Gregory and Chips sat on the floor grating. their feet dangled down into the well where they had pulled up the floor grating, and Gregory tapped his toes lightly on the still-closed hatch while they waited for the signal from Shakes.

Gregory seemed a little nervous. "Ehhh, Chips, want be to close and seal this fucking watertight bulkhead door behind me there? Seems like if Shakes' welds fail completely when we open this hatch, and maybe the _Gnat_ tears the fuck away or something, we'll be flooding the whole fucking _Prospect_ from this hole we're opening in the bottom of the boat, eh?"

"It ain't no sich feckin' thing Gregry. Since we's buttoned up, and close to the surface, this hole won't let no much water int' the feckin' boat. The water pressure at this depth is close t' the air pressure inside th' _Prospect_, so it'll werk more or less like one of them futuristic feckin 'moon pools' right?"

"Ah, interesting."

"Still, ain't nothing werk feckin' perfect ever, keep that fecking portable bilge pump ready..."

They could hear the _Gnat_ grinding against the mating collar of the _Prospect_ now in a grating and nerve-wracking way. And then the loud crunch of the two boats coming together.

"Sound's like he's feckin' on." Said Chips. "We wait til we get the OK from feckin' Hemi tho'."

Gregory nodded.

They could feel the shuddering vibrations of the _Gnat's_ motor through the hull of the _Prospect_ for a few minutes, and then that died away as Shake's shut it down. A few moments later the _Prospect's_ motors shut down too. They heard Shakes bang out shave-and-a-haircut on the top hatch of the _Gnat_ with one of his wrenches, and then it was quite silent til Hemi came crackling over the ship PA. "OK Chips, open it up."

Chips nodded to Gregory, and he reached down into the hatch well, and cranked open the sealing wheel. He pulled up the hatch and water rapidly flooded up around their feet. Gregory jumped up, as if bitten. But Chips lay out flat on the grating, and reached her hand down and felt along the welds until she could feel water pushing in. As she had predicted, the water rose, but stopped a few fingers above the hatch level.

"It's definit'ly feckin leaking, shitty motherfeckin welds. Get the feckin' pump hooked up Gregory, and let's get as much of this feckin' water out of 'ere as fecking possible. Then I'll see if I can weld it decent feckin like."

While Gregory got the hoses for the bilge pump organized, she got on the PA with Hemi. "We gotta feckin fix these shitty feckin welds or it'll flood the fecking _Gnat_ when we open the feckin' hatch Hemi. Tell Shakes to sit feckin tight, and not to do a feckin' thing." Hemi acknowledged, and she started putting her welding gear on.

It was cold, frustrating, cramped work. But such had been all of Chips work on this trip, maybe her whole life. She let out a never-slowing stream of curses, attempting to damn down to a permanent watery hell not just all materials and work processes, but all the societal systems and turns of fate that had consipired against her to bring her to this particular misery. 

The welds were horrifically ugly, like patch work on Frankenstein's monster. Stopping the leaks had required hammering metal sheet patches into place, and welding them down tight. Chips felt lucky that she hadn't cut through the mating ring of the hull of the _Gnat_ and made the situation even worse.

Eventually no more water seeped in though, and the pump sucked the water out the well, leaving them looking at the recessed domed top hatch of the _Gnat_. The whole mess was holding, though Chips thought she would never want to test it at any depth deeper than they already were.

Chips banged on the hatch with the end of the welding torch. "Eh Shakes ya fecker. You can open this fecker up now." She yelled into the empty metal well, her voice bouncing the curses back at her. There was the sound of the rusty sealing gears squeaking open and the hatch lifted up. 

Shakes was grinning up at them as water dripped down on him. "Who's a fuckin' anglerfish now, eh motherfuckers?"

"Don't touch them welds when ya come through, the feckers are still feckin' hot."

Shakes put his arms up through the hatch hole, found a place to grab that wasn't warm from welding, lifted his foot to some footing in the sail of the _Gnat_, and stepped up into the _Prospect_. Gregory pushed the ship intercom button and told Hemi they had Shakes aboard. 

"Fucking right. Now the hard part." Said Hemi over the intercom. Then got on the ship PA, and asked everyone to meet him down at the hatch to the _Gnat_.


### Rigging up power to the Prospect

"So basically we're going to suck the life out of the _Gnat_ to keep the _Prospect_ going." Hemi told them all when they were all crammed in, assembled on both sides of the open hatch to the _Gnat_ below. Shakes squirmed. "I'm going to set up some heavy jumpers between the _Gnat's_ battery banks and the battery rooms of the _Prospect_ that y'all are standing in right now. That should be pretty straightforward, and give us access to the _Gnat's_ remaining battery power. Not much, in terms of the _Prospect_.

"Chips, I need you to do the harder part and figure out how to get the fuel left in the _Gnat_ into the _Prospect's_ engines. I'm not sure if it's better to try to pump it up into the _Prospect's_ fuels tanks, or run it straight from the _Gnat's_ fuel tanks to the _Prospect's_ diesels."

"Be feckin easier to just run a long hose up to th' feckin _Prospect's_ feckin' fuel pumps. Won't have to feck around with the trim as much." Put in Chips.

"If you think that'll fucking work, it sounds fucking OK to me." Said Hemi. "Cap, you want to weigh in with anything?"

"This fuckin project is all you, Hem." Said Captain Percy.

"From this moment on, we need to shut down absolutely everything we aren't using. We should have been doing this already, but we need every bit of power we can suck out of the _Gnat_ to get across the Authority line into vaguely friendlier waters. The good news is, if we get the diesels going, you can all take some rotations in the rack, since there will be no power to do anything else but sleep anyway.

"Chips, you take Owen and Gregory, Bastian we'll go dig up those jumpers. Try to stay out of each other's way everyone." Finished up Hemi. He grabbed Bastian's skinny arm and led him away to stowage where he hoped he could find the long heavy jumpers he remembered seeing there sometime in the last year.

Chips took Owen and Gregory off to the engine rooms to get the long fuel hoses they normally used for refueling down off their racks on the wall.

Captain Percy looked down at the mess of patches and foul blackened welds that lined the passageway down through the hole in the bottom of her boat, and for a moment couldn't believe they were still afloat. "Shakes," she said to the only person left with her, "let me buy you a cup of coffee."


### Rigged up and running

In a matter of a couple of hours they had a series of umbilicals running through the _Prospect_ and down into the _Gnat_. The big submarine was parasitically sucking the small supply of nutrients the little sub had: power wired into the _Prospect's_ battery bays so that the _Gnat's_ batteries were now no more than an extra battery bay for the _Prospect_ --- conveniently with a nearly-full charge, and the thick fuel lines ran up to the engine room, where the fuel pumps were engaged and trimmed to gently suck the fuel up from the _Gnat's_ fuel ballast tanks.

To conserve fuel they only ran one of the _Prospect's_ multiply redundant diesel engines, and likewise only one of the electric motors, driving only one of the propellers, and compensating with some angle on the rudder. Normally they would also be charging the battery banks up while running on diesel, but they needed to put the all the fuel they had into forward motion. It was a filthy inelegant mess, but they were making headway.

Captain Percy insisted everyone who wasn't doing something actively should be in the rack, and Chips, Shakes, and Hemi didn't argue when they were assigned first shift in bed. She had Bastian and Gregory, who were more experienced with the controls of the boat, at the helm seats. She put Owen on radar, and they shut down the sonar figuring with the diesel running they wouldn't be able to hear anything until it was too close to do anything about it anyway, considering they couldn't dive or really do any other escape maneuver. But Percy wanted the radar on. It would be just stupid to run into a fleet of Authority surface enforcement ships. So Owen sat in the dark with his eye on the glowing radar screen, going a little insane watching it circle around endlessly.

Percy made them all drink two cups of coffee, which she fixed for them in the dark by the light of a penlight because Hemi insisted they couldn't afford to run lighting.

After a few hours of running like this --- the ship humming and vibrating under them, the superstructure groaning with the stress of dragging along the _Gnat_ and being thrust in one direction by her one turning propeller, and the other direction by her rudder --- Percy decided she needed to see how far they'd gone. At the navigation table, she measured with the calipers and laid down a string of hashed marks from the x marking the spot where they had mated the _Gnat_. 

It was terrifyingly slow going. With the calipers, she spun out the remaining distance to the line Shakes had drawn marking where they would be under a different, hopefully safer,  Authority. She estimated they still had something like eight hours to go. And that was assuming Shakes' line was at all accurate. In addition to just being a rough mark Shakes had laid down from memory, the Authorities might have battled or treatied the line into a totally different part of the ocean for all she knew. They wouldn't be really safe until they were docked at the depot, and even then who knew what the depot folks would be like. Somewhat friendlier to commerce was about all you could hope for with any confidence.

After six hours of non-stop droning darkness, Percy made another pot of coffee, and brought it down to the crew quarters with a few of tin cups tied together with a small bit of wire. She used her flashlight to hunt her relief crew out of their respective racks, and forced coffee into them. Chips strung curses at her, but as red as Chips' eyes were they weren't even close to the bloodshot droop that Percy was dragging around in her eyeballs now.

"Chips, go up and relieve Owen at radar. Hemi you're with me at the controls." Shakes had pulled the blackout curtain aside and was peering blearly down at them and their coffee from a top rack. "Shakes, you can go back to sleep man."

"No fucking way. My boat's on the line here too. I can help y'all drive this fucking tub of yers."

"I won't insist otherwise. Have a cup of coffee, we'll put you on the throttle/rudder. Shouldn't be much to do."


### Radar contact with the pursuing sub

With Hemi and Shakes at the controls, and Gregory, Owen, and Bastian stumbling off wearily following the arcs of their flashlights to their racks, Percy lit up a cigarillo, and sat down next to Chips at the radar station. Neither of them said anything, they were both too tired for conversation. It looked like it was taking all of Chips' remaining aggressive energy to keep her eyes following the rotating line of the radar around the scope.

Captain Percy jumped to her feet. Sitting was not going to work, she realized she was falling asleep despite the discomforts of the chair designed to keep you upright and alert. She flicked on her flashlight and leaned over to the navigation table, and again measured the distance to Shakes' imaginary line in the ocean. Their progress was hobbling along.

"Cap'" Chips broke the numbing silence. "Feckin' got somethin'."

Percy stepped back to the radar/sonar station and leaned over the scope. A small and distant blip was appearing and fading away with each pass of the _Prospect's_ radar. "Fuck. Well, it was probably too fucking much to hope the ocean would remain empty for us. OK, shut down the radar, switch to sonar."

"T'won't be able t' hear feckin much with the diesel runnin'.

"That's why you're going to have to really fucking focus, try to pick out any change in mechanical sound above the diesel. If you think you hear something, we'll shut it down and have a quiet listen. Otherwise we'll stop every half hour or so and see if we hear anyone coming towards us."

Chips groaned. "Better fill my fecking coffee back up." Percy nodded and pointed her flashlight towards the galley after watching to make sure Chips shut down the radar completely. It was possible for a surface ship to see that radar while it was running and not only discover they were there, but calculate exactly where they were. Passive sonar was just microphones in the water --- it didn't send anything out by which they could be tracked. Of course their noisy diesel engine was sending out plenty of sound at the moment, if anyone got close enough to listen for it.

Coming back with a full tin cup of burnt black coffee and sugar solution, Captain Percy called up to Hemi through the hatch up to the control room. When his face appeared squinting into the beam of her light, she told him they had a distant contact and had shut down the radar and switched to sonar, and that he should be ready to shut down the diesel on notice. He nodded and headed back to the dive plane and tank controls.

She put the coffee cup down in front of Chips and sat down next to her. Percy put on the second sonar headset and listened with Chips. The headset was full of the heavy droning hum of the diesel engine, moderated by some swish of water running along the hull and grinding against the sail of the _Prospect_ where it split through the surface.

Captain Percy flipped some switches to engage filters, and the texture of the sound in her ears changed. She blocked out some of the lower frequencies of the engine, and tried to imagine if she hear the higher pitch of a ship screw spinning in the water. But the sound was relentlessly unchanging.

After half an hour or so, she called up to Hemi to shut down the diesels so they could have a listen, and a minute later a blessed silence came into the headset. A unsupressable feeling of relief flowed through her as the silence filled her ears. Sometimes she wondered if the eternal hum of machines that accompanied life aboard a submarine subtly and slowly ate away at her soul. On top of that, there was no apparent sound of any other ships in sonar range.

Percy flipped through a few filters, and the quality of the silence changed, from a deadening whoosh to a soft hiss. And then she heard a pulse. A distant, faint heartbeat in the ocean, accompanied by the slushing flow of circulation. She touched Chips arm, pointed to the softly fluttering signal-strenth gauge.

"Ay." Confirmed Chips. "That's the right direction for our feckin' contact. They jes feckin moved int' feckin sonar range."

"Fuck. We're gonna have to do something. Stay on it Chips."

"Feckin' ay."

Percy scaled the ladder up to the control room, and raised the periscope, twisting it around as it rose to the heading of the contact, on their rear starboard quarter. She didn't expect to see anything, and didn't. The distance was still too far, but a visual check was the practical and right thing to do first. She lowered the periscope.


### They submerge to periscope depth

"Hemi," Percy hesitated, "I think we gotta fucking submerge to periscope depth --- get the sail underwater --- and run on the _Gnat's_ remaining fucking batteries. How long can we fucking last?"

"Well, putting aside the risk of again opening the main ballast valves to bring us lower in the water, the _Gnat_ has maybe an hour of battery we could use at this super slow creep rate we're going at. And I should also point out that when that's gone, we have no other way to hide if we don't lose this contact, or if we do come across another."

"I know. I'm going on instinct here, and fuck me I could fucking be wrong. Especially considering I haven't slept in days and my head is fucking killing me from eight cups of coffee a day. But I got a sense we don't want to fucking see that fucker coming towards us up there."

"Or, we don't want that fucker to see us, you mean."

"Fuck right."

Hemi nodded. "Alright. I'll open the main ballast valves." He reached up and pushed the dive alarm.

"Ah feck ye all," Chips yelled up to them, pulling one earpiece of the headset off her ear when she heard the dive alarm, "yer feckin' taking us down to periscope dep', ain't ya? We can't run the diesels at periscope, there's no way to feed 'em oxygen. So how the feck are ya planning to get back on the surface if the batteries die, eh? We'll have no way to steer th' boat to the surface, and we got no feckin' way to pump the water out! We'll jes' be feckin' sitting there with one fucking eyeball view above the surface, 'fectively fecking drowned."

"Thank you for aprising us of the risks Chips." Percy yelled back. "Hemi, take us down to periscope."

Hemi flipped up the main ballast valve switches and there was again a rush of air as more of it was released from the top of the ballast tanks, and water eased in from the vents open to the sea on the bottom. Hemi watched the glowing depth gauge until the needle got into the range marked 'periscope,' and then flipped the ballast valve switches down again. There was a clink and the rush of air and water stopped.

"See Chips, the fucking valves are still working as they are supposed to, which we knew because of your inspection earlier. We aren't fucking sunk yet."

"'Pends on what ye feckin' mean by 'sunk'." Said Chips quietly.

"We can't afford to take an evasive route to the depot Hemi, we gotta go straight at 'em. So we'll just have to hope our fucking contact up there wasn't able to track us long enough to figure out our course. Put us back on the electric motor --- they won't be able to hear us unless they get right on top of us." Said Percy. "Um... also keep what Chips said in mind --- make sure we have a little something left in the batteries to get us back to the surface."

"These battery gauges are hardly very precise Percy. I would not push it beyond ten minutes remaining on the battery." Said Hemi.

"Make sure I know when we're about 20 minutes from empty batteries." Said Percy. She raised the periscope and aimed it again in the direction of the contact they had heard on sonar.


### Tracking the contact moving towards them

Sometimes new crew members thought it must be something of a mental relief to be able to look through the periscope after days or weeks inside a submarine, to have even a brief glimpse of the surface world. Captain Percy remembered believing this herself when she first started working on submarines. And honestly, she would give her crew shifts on the periscope if she believed it would actually help keep them mentally steady. But the control room was already cramped, and more than that, she knew from years of experience sighting through periscopes that it didn't help. Sometimes it made the claustrophobia of the sub worse. At periscope depth, the viewport end of the device couldn't be more than a meter or two above the surface. There was rarely anything to see except a world entirely made up of an undifferentiated horizon of lighter gray against dark gray. It was almost always like that, and right now was no exception.

On the surface, it was night. A reasonable moon above the cloud layer meant there was enough light to see the ocean swells. The swells were moderately significant, which was good --- they would be harder to hear on sonar and almost impossible to spot visually. Through the scope Percy watched the black swells rise and fall around her, pushing up and letting down the lighter gray field of the sky with a tuned cadence. It was a little dizzying and almost nauseating. Every so often the swell would pass over the top of the periscope and she would have a few seconds of blackness as a relief.

"Chips!" Percy gave her command a little more emphasis because she didn't remove her face from the periscope frame. "Make sure you stay on that fucking sonar contact. Track the direction and range. Let me know if they get within something like visual range."

"Ay, I'ma feckin' trackin' their fecking course a'ready. Feckin surprise! They're fecking coming towards us. Still out ten miles or so."

"Fuck." Whispered Percy into the steel column of the periscope in front of her. She swung the scope slowly back and forth across the bearing.

Minutes passed in silence, except for the faint hum of the one electric motor pushing them forward slowly through the water, and Chips occasionally calling out ranges. It was quickly marching towards them.

"Feckers are moving fast and loud Capt." Called up Chips. "Like they ain't 'fraid of no feckin' shit."

"That's how armed ships behave." Said Hemi from the control seat. "Probably caught a whiff of us at a distance, and they are charging fast into a range where they can quiet down and take a listen; try to acquire the sound of our electric motor on sonar."

Deep within Captain Percy she pushed down a primitive instinct urging her to run. A fresh young sub driver might crank on as much throttle as possible to move away from a threat. But evolution had moved submarines into a different escape tactic: slink away silently. They were in a very, very slow-speed race: get out of range of the pursuer's sonar, as slowly and quietly as possible.

After a few more minutes of staring at black empty sea, seeing nothing and at the same time knowing they were out there, Percy could no longer stand just relying on Chips' range estimates. She lowered the periscope and slipped down the ladder and stepped over to the navigation table. Chips immediately understood what she was doing, and without saying anything handed Percy a piece of scrap paper on which she had written a list of ranges and bearings for the contact in pencil. 

Captain Percy leaned over the navigation table, holding her flashlight pointed at their location on the chart with one hand while reading the markings on Chips' paper and laying down the contact's course and times on the chart with a grease pencil in her other hand. She them marked out their own progress since they picked up the contact on sonar, but it was so short it almost didn't merit marking on the map.

"Fuck they're moving fast." Said Percy to herself. "We might be able to fucking see them already."

"Feckin' possible, ya." Agreed Chips.


### Percy sees the black sub through the periscope again

Percy scaled the ladder up to the control room quickly, and raised the periscope, spinning it to look out over their rear quarter as it rose. She scanned for just a moment, and then there was a long, low dark shadow running across the black surface of the water. It kicked up whitecaps where it plowed through the swells, and left a string of white wake behind it. A large black fin rose from the body of the black shadow and from that fin a soft red glow followed by a long black stream of soot marking it's passage through the air in parallel to its wake marking its passage through the water. Even as Percy watched the red glow faded, and the white wake died away. They were shutting down their diesels so they could hear better.

The black submarine was two or three miles off, and running across the path the _Prospect_ had traveled along. So from where Percy was she could see the whole length of the boat. And mounted to its bow was the same medieval ramming contraption she had seen before. The same that had ripped a wound in her boat.

"Fuck. It's that same fucking sub that rammed us. Shut down the motor Hemi. We're going silent, and hopefully they'll miss us."

The hum of the electric motor died away. Captain Percy watched the back sub through the periscope. They had engaged their own electric motors and were moving forward again. The bow suddenly sunk under the black swells of the ocean, and the rest of the deck followed a few moments later. Streams of misted water were shooting up from its deck as Percy watched the sail sinking into the black line where the surface met the sky.

"They're diving." Percy told Hemi. "Chips! They went down. With our motors off, you should still be able to hear them on sonar. Track 'em, and let me know what the fuck they're doing."

"Ay Capt." Chips called back up from sonar.

Percy let the periscope sink down to its recess.

"Should we get moving?" Hemi asked.

"No. Let's see if we can figure out what they're doing first. We'll hide silently and cower for the moment." Percy lit a cigarillo and pulled at it between her lips. "We'll fuckin' wait."

They waited. It took maybe twenty minutes for Chips to give a report. She called Percy down to the navigation table.

"Feckin' look 'ere," said Chips "I tracked the feckers down from where we first feckin' heard 'em. They shot right to the last location we were runnin' the feckin' diesels. A' few feckin' miles behind us now. But, aft'r they submerged, they didn't turn to feckin' foller us, they turned the other fecking way, and then kept turnin'." Chips marked out their path in a circle away from them on the chart.

"Fucking search pattern eh?" Said Percy.

"Feck ye, if'n I ever seen one. They lookin' for us, but don't know where t' feckin' look, is my feckin' thinkin'."


### They try to run from the black sub

"Fuckin' good. This is our chance. We gotta get out of range before they complete their cunt-licking search circle and start a new circle in our direction." Percy called up to Hemi. "Get us moving again Hem'. Back to a creep, same heading --- toward the depot."

The hum of the electric motors came back up, and the _Prospect_ steadily moved on. Percy sat with Chips at the sonar station and listened to the sound of the black sub's screws off in the distance.  The signal grew very weak as the black sub got off to the far end of their search circle, but grew stronger as they returned to the starting point. Percy continually marked their track on the navigation chartaccording their range finding calculations.

"We're not out of this yet." Percy said to Chips. "They're moving fast. Makes it easy to fucking track 'em, but their next search circle will almost certainly be the other side of a figure-eight directly the opposite direction of their first --- and directly towards us." Chips nodded. "We gotta be out of range of their search circle before they go past."

"They could feckin' ping us with active sonar and feckin' find us that way." Pointed out Chips.

"And they fucking might yet. But they might be not want to risk us being an armed enemy ship. Trying to get a soft sense of their target first, if they can."

"We're feckin screwed if they ping us then."

"Hopefully they fucking won't. Give me a new batch of ranges to them." Chips read out the ranges, and Percy marked them down. The black sub had completed their circle, passed through the point they had started at, and were moving in the opposite direction now. "They're coming towards us." Said Percy.


### Percy decides to hold still and wait them out

Captain Percy did some quick math. She knew the black sub's speed, and in a few minutes of ranges from Chips, she knew the arc of their second search circle. The _Prospect_ was cutting almost directly across that circle, but so slowly compared to the speed of the black sub that there was no way they were going to get out of range in time. At their current rate they might just meet them at the far point of the circle at the same time they arrives. She stood back from the navigation table, holding her flashlight on the chart with one hand and sucking at her cigarillo with the other. She leaned over and put a small x at the _Prospect's_ current location --- almost exactly in the middle of what would eventually be the black sub's completed search circle.

"Hemi," she called up to the control room, "shut her down again. Let's make a hole in the water."

The electric motor died away leaving the _Prospect_ completely silent. Hemi came down from the control room and ran his light over the chart, and immediately understood. "We weren't going to make it outside their search area in time, so instead we'll hid in the fucking middle of it, eh?"

"Could be a fucking stupid move." Percy replied. "Nothing preventing them from fucking taking on a zigzag course all of a sudden."

"We're essentially counting on their sheer fucking sense of symmetry."

"Fuck, you put it that way it gives me a fucking wisp of hope. Symmetry can be a powerful fucking thing sometimes."

Chips, for once, was not listening to their conversation and instead had both headset pieces over her ears, and was concentrating on the contact. Every minute or so she scratched down range and bearing data on the finger-stained pad in front of her, while her callused hand slowly slipped the sonar directional wheel along to follow the contact. Percy tapped her on the shoulder, and she pulled back one of the earpieces. "Chips, I'm gonna have Hemi take over sonar tracking. We need our best ears for this. Go make sure everyone in the boat knows we need to stay absolutely silent. I don't want anyone deciding now is the time to take a huge shit and start flushing the head repeatedly trying to wash it down."

"Feck and good riddn'ce, I fecking hate fecking sonar anyway. Turns yer fecking mind into a fecking numbed rock." She set the headset down and picked up her nearly-empty tin cup of cold coffee and her flashlight and headed forward towards the crew quarters.

Hemi sat down, and slid the sonar headset open as far as it would go before the earpieces went over the ears on his huge head. He handed the paper with Chips listed bearings on it to her. Percy started plotting them down on the chart, the black sub's search circle making its way steadily around in front of their location.

"Give me bearing and range every minute or so, Hem'." She stretched the second sonar headset wire over to the navigation table, and put an earpiece over one ear so she could hear what Hemi was hearing. She left the other ear open so she could hear Hemi's direction and rage readings.

The boat now was totally silent in a way that only submarines could be. Surface ships were constantly swamped with sound, the sounds of water moving, the never-ceasing racket of the wind passing over the boat, not the mention the fact that the loud rumble of the engines was rarely ever stopped at sea. A submarine was held suspended in a medium that ironically both transmitted sound better than air, but also isolated human ears evolved for sound that moved through air.
She could hear Hemi controlling his steady breathing to keep it from impinging on his contact. With nothing to do with the boat shut down, Shakes sat on the floor of the control room with his legs dangling down through the hatch, smoking a cigarette. Percy could head his long draws on the cigarette, and the paper crackling as it was burned away by the coal moving towards Shakes' lips.

Hemi had shut off all the filters they normally had to engage on the sonar to filter out any contact signal from their own noise. So in the earpiece, Percy could hear an unusually rich cross-spectrum white noise that was the background sound of the deep ocean. Smack in the middle was the whirring and crackling of the contact's propellers stirring through the water. Hemi was extremely good at keeping the sonar mics tracking the source, so they rarely wavered in intensity.The signal was so clear she could almost see the propellers moving, her mind playing a strangely synaesthetic game of converting sound input into a visual representation. 

With syncopated regularity, Hemi broke the silence to give her the range and direction. Every time he did, she added a small dash to the chart. The black sub had moved directly in front of them, mere miles away. If the _Prospect_ had still be running her motor, the black sub would definitely had heard them. And if the black sub was willing to risk an active ping at this range, they would know the _Prospect's_ location instantly. Percy had her boat hiding in plain sight, in submarine terms. The only tactic they had at the moment was grinding, tense patience.

Percy matched her breathing to Hemi's. She focussed on the sound of the black sub's propellers in her ear piece. She raised up her own calm, and pushed down any fear she had. She slowly grew the dashed line on the chart as it lassoed them in, placing each dash with deliberate care, the pencil creating a long thin shadow across the chart in the light of her flashlight.  The little x marking their location on the chart looked like the rendering of an eyeball of a cartoon dead man. When the black sub had passed in front of them, and was moving on the final part of the arc to complete their search circle, she decided it was time for them to sneak away.


### They get moving again

She put her hand on Hemi's shoulder and he looked over at her. "Get us moving."

"Same heading, towards the depot?" Hemi asked.

"It's our only option. Keep it slow and quiet though."

Hemi stood, pulling off the sonar headset. He tapped Shakes on the foot, and Shakes' dangling feet withdrew up into control room. Hemi climbed up and a few moments later, the hum of the _Prospect's_ electric motors returned, accompanied by a very mild sensation of acceleration.

Captain Percy stayed at the sonar station. She tracked the progress of the black sub which had begun a third clover leaf searching circle away from them. They were still moving relatively fast, and in 20 minutes they were far enough away that she wasn't able to track them any more over sonar. Their own track on the chart had pushed them out beyond the range of the black sub's circle patter. It was always possible they would swing back around an intercept them again, but Percy realized she was breathing normally again. Her guts told her they had snuck out from under that one, though they still had a little ways to go to get across Shakes' supposed Authority control line.


### They go back to sail-up and fire up the diesels

It was not long before Hemi called down to her again. "Captain, we don't have much battery left. Roughly, maybe 20 minutes."

"Fuck." Said Percy, standing at the navigation table, and using calipers to measure their remaining distance to the Authority Control line that Shakes had left on her chart. "We're still at least 10 minutes from getting under that Authority Control line."

"Eh," Shakes called down, "I wouldn't put too much stock in that line. Could be plus or minus by, like, eh, 50 fuckin' miles ya know."

Percy climbed up to the control room. "Wherever the line is, we can't risk staying submerged anymore. Give us some upward dive plane Hemi, put our sail back over the surface. We'll have a good listen and then switch the diesels back on."

Hemi rotated the dive plane angle and indicated shakes should give them just a little bit more throttle. The bow of the _Prospect_ rose, and the depth gauge worked it's way down toward its zero pin. Percy had Hemi go listen on the sonar rig, and when he reported no contacts, she shut down the electric motors, and switched the diesels on. With the extra power of the diesels running, she had them run the air compressors and pump air back into the main ballast tanks and trim tanks until the boat had enough buoyancy to stay at the surface even without the motors pushing them forward and the dive planes angled to push them up.

"With some luck boys, we can be at the depot in a few more hours, and maybe still with a few whiffs of fuel left to pump from the _Gnat_. Shakes, we're gonna owe you big for this." 

"Normally I'd say I'm just happy to help, but fuck that," said Shakes, "y'all sucked the life out of my little boat. A little financial help when we get t' the depot would go a long way..."

"It's going to be something of a layout for us to get the _Prospect_ repaired, refueled, and fitted up for another cargo run. We'll do what we can for the _Gnat_, but don't expect a major reward or anything. It ain't like you rescued some fuckin' Authority oligarchs out there."

"Ya, fuck, I'll keep that in mind next time I stop to see what kinda help folks need."

When they crept under where the Authority Control line was, Percy put the periscope up and scanned the horizon. She saw some aircraft off in the distance, but they weren't coming towards the _Prospect._ Soon, Percy felt like they must be in new Authority waters. But there was really no way to tell.

They cruised easily with the sail up and the diesels running for the next few hours. Hemi repeatedly made the trek down to through the _Prospect_ and into the _Gnat_ to check the remaining fuel. He didn't trust the _Gnat's_ fuel gauges, so each time he opened up the fuel tank and put in a dip stick and noted the fuel level remaining. He found Chips asleep in her rack, and got her up to go tend the engines. "Tune 'em to within a fuckin' inch of their life for efficient fuel consumption!" he told her. And she spend the rest of the trip to the depot deep in the ship, carefully and continually trimming the diesel engine's fuel usage.

No matter how parsimonious they were with the power usage and the fuel consumption though, the _Prospect_ was so much bigger that it was eating through the remaining fuel in the _Gnat_ at an insatiable rate. Back in the control room of the _Prospect_ Hemi calculated their fuel consumption rate by hand, and measured it against how far they had to go. It was super tight, and he could not promise Percy that they would not be rowing the _Prospect_ the last few miles.

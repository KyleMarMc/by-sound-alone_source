# Built out prose (draft 4) of subworld story 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



### Opening scene --- night on a black dead calm sea

The weight of the atmosphere pressed the still night air down on the surface of the ocean. The water compressed under the weight, flattened and stilled, unable to raise enough energy to give more than an occasional barely perceptible heave to the glassy smoothness. A dome of heavy dark clouds above held the weight down and pressed, like a schoolyard miscreant torturing some stick-legged runt. The clouds were dimly lit to the color of the charred edges of a coal by a distant and feeble moon, not visible and kept out, on the other side of the impenetrable dome of cloud. That moon rested up there untormented by the pressure of the atmosphere, but unable to muster enough warmth to do anything about it. It merely had to stand by and watch as the cupped clouds compressed the surface. It was all it could do to provide even the coldest dimmest light. The light that filtered down through layer upon layer of gray cloud was so diluted and refracted that it left the sky only a few shades lighter than the water. 

The ocean was black. While above the atmosphere rode heavenly bodies that radiated light and heat, and the thick gasses of the atmosphere carried some portion of that warmth down to the surface, below the water was darkness and cold, and the viscous liquid sent that darkness up to the surface. The darkness yielded not at all to the pressure of the atmosphere above.

On this unvarying plain of black a point appeared. A miniscule and meaningless point, like the first push of a needle through the underside of a new piece of fabric, the workings of which would soon join the fabric irrevocably and forever to another with hundreds of interwoven taught stitches, pulled tight by binding thread. The point rose, a long thin wire sting extruded up, piercing through the surface. A thin V-shaped wake trailed behind it in the water marking its course. The wire bent back against the pressure of the air, as it grew up from the surface, it bent over more until it's tip was nearly horizontal to the surface of the water, held there in a long gracefully arcing line.

At its base the wire rested on a short steel mast which broke through the surface a moment later, accompanied by a series of a half dozen other masts, each leaving a more significant wake behind it. The low string of wakes carved up the black surface behind the path of the masts with their nested Vs.

A flat black oblong pushed through the surface and rose up into the air. Water streamed across the flat top and down the smooth metal sides of the oblong. It became a curved vertical wall, in the same manner seismic forces raised up a new continent, and thrust up against the pressure of the atmosphere. Water shot out of vents in the side of the walls, draining out interior spaces that had been filled when it was submerged. The oblong was pushed up by the giant body it sprouted from. An enormous flat deck broke in a long line far before and abaft of the oblong. The sea water washed over and off the deck, running down the curved sides that now revealed themselves supporting the deck from below. The surface gave before the unrelenting push of this monster, and a wake of dull gray broke on the smooth black surface behind it.

At first it moved with total silence, other than the sound of the water pushing and running along it's sides and the soft crash of the curling water it left behind it. Then it coughed, spit, and from two pipes that opened at the top of it's oblong dorsal fin two arcs of flame burst orange into the surrounding blackness, spraying apocalyptic color across the landscape of pitch. The flames flashed over the blackness and reflected off the low clouds, and then died back into the pipes from which they came, leaving behind the rolling churn of exploding diesel and hot air pouring up through the pipes and forcing the shutters that normally protected them from the influx of water to remain open.

The engines of the machine revved up, and then maintained a loud high pitch, generating energy to drive it forward with contained combustion followed by blowing heat. The surfaced ship maintained an unvarying speed.

There was a recessed well set into the top of the dorsal fin. At the bottom of this shallow well, there was the creak of a rusty wheel turning, and a crescent moon of red light split the black bottom of the well and widened into a perfect circle as a hatch lifted open. The shadow of a figure climbed through it and stood upright on the deck followed by another much larger shadow. Both figures looked around at the darkness, lit only by the red glow at their feet. They leaned forward and rested against the fairing. The smaller figure made a few extra gestures in the darkness, and then a match light glowed against the end of a stubby cigarillo.

Captain Percy gestured with the glowing coal of the cigarillo out at the darkness. The figure next to her, dwarfing her in size, just nodded. There was no need to describe the all-consuming blackness aloud.

"Fucking perfect night for a surface run." Said the giant figure.

"Perfect night to contemplate your own fucking doom, Hemi." Said Captain Percy.

"It seems that in our business, we're always safest when our doom is closest by. Wear your doom like a blanket, Captain."

"A blanket keeps you warm, our doom is unlikely to be very warm. It's probably best if you keep your fucking imaginative comparisons to fucking yourself Hemi."

"Perhaps so." Hemi paused, there was no reason to rush anything this night. "The usual plan for tonight then?"

"Same as every other fucking night Hemi. Charge up the batteries, run on the surface to the light cracks the sky. Make sure your keep those fucking insolent pissants at the controls awake."

Hemi put one huge hand on her shoulder and turned to climb down through the hatch. Captain Percy pulled on her cigarillo and the coal at the tip glowed in the darkness. Her doom would eventually probably be a doom of freezing, she knew that, but at least tonight it was warm enough to be up on the top of her ship. The blackness lay on it, and she did indeed find it comforting that in the blackness, nobody could see them. If she controlled all the levers of the universe, her boat would never be seen.


### They get rammed by a black sub

Captain Percy stayed on the bridge of the sail for hours, smoking her way through one cigarillo after another, her thoughts spiraling out into the darkness. For a long time it was a study in sensory deprivation. The diesel engines were loud enough but unvarying. So too, the vibration from them that came up through the steel-grate deck and shook her boots never changed in frequency or amplitude. The blackness around her seemed never-ending, though the boat pushed relentlessly forward. It occurred to Captain Percy that when her boat, the _Prospect_ was submerged, this is what it must be like outside --- silent and black. It felt like she had loosed the bonds of her corporal body and had floated outside it, so she could experience what her boat was like when it was pushing through the icy blackness of an alien world where the pressure would collapse a corporal body into a mush of hemoglobin and fats.

As with many things that seem interminable, the slow but persistent forward motion eventually forced the dome of clouds to relent, and they crawled out under a sky of stars and a weak, low moon. Captain Percy could see her hand holding her cigarillo now and the long shadow of the _Prospect_ stretching out before her, parting the waters to allow her to pass as she rode astride this beast of hers.

Captain Percy knew her boat well. She had spent enough time with it to have internalized its movements. She almost always knew what the boat was doing just by the feeling of it --- the angle of the deck, the vibrations of the engines or motors, even at depth, when the struts and structures of the boat groaned under the weight of the water above, the sounds of the boat under pressure felt like the normal sounds of a huge human taking a great weight on its shoulders. The only time she ever worried was when the _Prospect_ conveyed sounds, or motions, or input to her that she couldn't recognize. It was now a collection of haptic feedback to her senses that made her feel a rise of panic in her chest. The boat shuddered, as if the cold water it had swam through all these years had finally gotten a reaction from it. And then Captain Percy was thrown violently against the fairing.

She immediately got down to the deck of the bridge. She stuck her head over the hatch hole and looked down to Hemi's large face looking up at her from a couple of decks below.

"I don't know!" He yelled up to her before she could ask. She could hear him giving orders to shut down the diesel engines and reverse the propellers.

The bow of the _Prospect_ had come to a dead stop, but the stern still had forward motion. Captain Percy could feel the whole boat turning unnaturally around its center axis, like the experiment of a child --- a magnetized pin through a cork floating in a bowl of water, pulled around by the invisible forces of planetary alignment.

The deck under her started to lean to the starboard side. Captain Percy braced one foot against the inside of the bridge well wall. The boat listed sickeningly. Captain Percy got to her feet, still braced against the angle of the boat. She gripped the fairing, peering out over the edge into the night, scanning for a cause. The water was still black and calm, though not quite glassy as it had been earlier in the night. They were far from shore, in fairly well-charted though relatively little-trafficked waters. These should have been safe waters, with nothing to hit.

For a few moments the boat hung at an angle, and then began to right itself. As the fairing came lower, Captain Percy could see more of the sea off to port, and there now rose there the black curve of another submarine. It poked its bow out of the water first, with a modified and reinforced jagged point, a medieval looking device intended for ramming ships. The bow was followed by the long black swelling curve of a military submarine, that rose from the surface with water smoothly flowing off its sides. The sail came up with dive planes on its side, set at an angle to raise the boat quickly. When the stern finally came up to the surface, it was mere meters away, its swirling wake washing white up the against the side of the _Prospect_. 

"...Like Satan dropped a fucking shit on us." Captain Percy said to herself as she climbed down through the hatch and the red crescent of light waned out of existence behind her.


### They crash dive

Captain Percy stood on the metal rungs of the ladder just under the topside hatch, and with one hand screwed shut the squeaking wheel of the hatch seal. She grasped the sides of the ladder and bypassing the rungs slid down into the cramped control room. Hemi looked at her through his small-framed spectacles.

"Down." She gave the one-word order as she pushed the button on the wall that activated the dive alarm. 

"Give me full speed forward." Said Hemi as he put one large hand on each of the shoulders of the two men who sat at the controls of the sub and gave them orders to dive the boat. One of these men was a stick-figure of a man who went by moniker Bastian. The other, Gregory had a meaty square forehead that echoed his meaty square body. Of the two of them, only Gregory looked like he belonged on a submarine.

Diving the sub required delicacy under the calmest circumstances. Now Hemi and the two men at the controls carefully timed their movements, their eyes scanning continually over the wall of dials and gauges in front of them, reflected in the red glow of the night lighting. Gregory and Bastian made adjustments according to Hemi's instructions by opening and closing various of the dozens of valves in front of them, or flipping on or off switches. The submarine let out a long exhale of breath, the air that had held it aloft being pressed out by an onrush of water into the flooding tanks.

"Flood the express dive tank." Ordered Hemi. Bastian reached up and opened a valve and water thrust through thick pipes deep into the deepest parts of the bow of the boat. The bow pitched steeply downwards and Captain Percy reached to grab old leather loops that hung overhead. She angled her feet against the incline and watched the depth gauge. 

The ship-to-ship radio above Captain Percy's head lit up, and over the speaker a recorded voice broadcast a warning that they were violating the territorial waters of someone they had never heard of, authorized by a series of treaties with titles that became acronyms that became words that contributed to further acronyms. The recording ordered them to surface and prepare to be boarded. Hemi punched the mute button on the radio.

"Territories and treaties are for the surface." Said Hemi. Captain Percy nodded.

But she was pissed. "This wouldn't have happened if we had someone listening to the sonar mics while we were running on the surface."

"We wouldn't have heard them coming over the diesels." Replied Hemi.

"We would have fucking known they were there soon enough to take some evasive action at least!"

"Later! We have to deal with being understaffed later. First let's get out from under this asshole."

There was barely enough space in the control room for 4 people. They were all breathing each other's air. Hemi, in his tweed suit, took a rag from a hook and wiped condensation from the glass faces of the dials and gauges, and then wiped the nervous sweat from his hands with the rag. 

"100 meters." Said Gregory.

"OK. Level us off." Said Hemi. Gregory and Bastian spun closed some of the trim tank valves and rolled the dive planes level. The angle of the boat slowly eased upwards. Captain Percy pulled out another cigarillo and lit it. She nervously sucked at it, and then ashed it into a tin cup that smelled of her stale coffee from three hours earlier.


### They realize there's something wrong

"Something isn't right." Said Captain Percy. Just like before when she was on the bridge, she knew something was wrong with her boat. There was no single instrument that reported anything amiss. But then no single instrument on a submarine described the whole being of the boat. They had to be taken together, internalized, and combined with what you felt the boat doing. She had to hold the depth in her head, while taking in the dive plane angle, and the speed. Normally this happened instinctively, she processed it all automatically, and she could just _feel_ what her boat was doing from a quick glance at this wall of dials combined with what her senses told her about the angle of the boat and dead reckoning from the accelerations she had experienced.

But it wasn't working right now. Her eyes scanned back and forth across the dials, but they didn't come together, she couldn't make sense of them, and could not figure out what was happening to her boat. In this steel tube with no windows, for the first time ever, she was truly blind.

"Hemi... what's going on...?"

"Fuck me if I know..." He reached past Gregory and turned the rudder. The boat came along, slowly. "Sluggish?"


### Captain Percy goes looking for what's wrong

"I need to go look her over. Let me know on the PA if something happens." Hemi nodded and Captain Percy slipped down the ladder to the deck below. She passed forward through navigation and sonar and down a steep flight of steel stairs and through the crew quarters where their third deck crew member, Owen, was snoring in his rack behind one of the moth-eaten old bed curtains since he was off watch. At the back of crew quarters, she went down another rusting steel ladder through a hatch to the lowest of the three main decks. If there were something wrong with her boat, this is the deck where it would be.

She flipped on the lights. There was no red night lighting rigged down here, it was just bare white bulbs in a string behind cages to keep them from being broken. In this part of the boat, the entire lower deck was full of batteries, strung together with rat's nest of black cables as thick as her finger. The batteries were bolted with steel straps to row upon row of steel shelves. The straps were rusting away and the cables were grouped together with wire ties and slung along the racks in heavy bundles. The floor was steel grating. She got to her knees, the steel grating pushing through her cracked brown leather pants. She put her fingers through the grating and lifted it up and put it aside. She reached her hand down and felt the raw steel hull of the pressure hull. It was cold, damp, and greasy, but that was normal. She replaced the grate and went on to the next compartment forward.

More batteries here, though fewer. They lined the walls, but not very deeply because there were trim tanks inside the pressure hull in this compartment. She checked below the grating again, but here too everything was normal. She passed forward from that compartment into the main cargo bay.

The main cargo bay was one giant compartment, more than thirty meters long and almost ten meters wide. The air was still and stale and smelled of rust. The lights were a harsh jaundiced yellow color. The hold was mostly empty --- they had been coming from their last dropoff and were heading towards the depots in the north in hopes of being hired for another shipment. A few molding wooden crates were stacked up along the sides, and a pile of rusted bicycles were stacked up and strapped down with leather straps to keep them from shifting in one corner. She walked along the center of it, listening carefully. It seemed to her there was something wrong with the sound of her footsteps on the metal grating. As she got toward the front of the compartment, she realized it wasn't her footsteps, it was that she could hear water trickling. She knelt down and pulled up the grating. There was a lake of oily black water just under the grating. The ramming had cracked the pressure hull, and the _Prospect's_ cargo bay was filling slowly with water.


### Hemi deals with the pursuing sub in the control room

"Keep this depth, and course, I'll be down in sonar listening for our friend." Hemi climbed down to the compartment below. From the sonar station he could still give orders to the control room, and hear reports from Gregory and Bastian. He remained standing at the sonar station, and slipped the old headphones onto his head, covering one ear and leaving the other free.

He spun the control wheel for the sonar around slowly, listening for human sounds out there in the darkness. It was dead silent.

"Hemi," Gregory called down through the hatch, "I'm having trouble keeping the boat level. I find I keep having to give it more dive plane angle just to keep from sinking."

"Let me come up and play with the trim tanks." Said Hemi, climbing back up to the control room. He stood at the trim tank controls and his thick fingers spun one small steel wheel, then the next. Each was accompanied by water pushing through pipes, flowing from one end of the boat to the other. "How's that?" Asked Hemi.

"Better, but still more plane angle that I would expect." Said Gregory.

Hemi didn't say out loud what he was thinking: they were sinking.


### Captain Percy goes to recruit Chips to help fix the leak

"Sweet fucking hell." She said to herself. "Sweet fucking hell!" She yelled. She ran up the cargo bay, and back into the battery compartments. She pulled the heavy watertight bulkhead closed behind her, and turned the wheel to seal it. It took all her strength, these seal were rarely used and steadily rusting themselves into stasis.

She climbed up a deck, and went back into the engine room, where the only sound was the quiet hum of the electric motors running in the next compartment back, and a clanking of tools from the deck below. She leaned over the open hatch to the lower engine room.

"Chips! Chips, come over here."

The clanking sound stopped and the face of the _Prospect's_ engineer peer up at her. Chips wore leather overalls stained with grease, and had her hair tied back in a thick black braid. Her hands were black with grease and were holding the body of a small deconstructed piece of machinery, as if she had been butchering some small game animal for dinner.

"Fuck's up?"

"There's a leak." These were words no submariner ever wanted to hear. But Chips had fixed leaks before. It was the answer to the next question that Captain Percy didn't want to have to give.

"Yar. Where's it?"

"...In the cargo bay."

"And's bad, ah?"

"Pretty fucking bad."

"So we're fuckin fucked then, ah? Fuckin fucked, cuz the cargo bay's too big, and the boat won't fuckin float if's flooded. ah Capt' Percy? Fuckin fucked!" She threw her piece of machinery at the wall where it clanged and sent small part flying into far dirty corners of the lower engine room.

"For fuck's sake Chips, yes we're fucked, but we're not _fuckin'_ fucked yet... I need you to take one of the guys, go in there, and see if you can stop it at patch it so we don't get to the point where we _are_ fuckin' fucked. Move!"

"Ah, fuck ya Capt." Chips started climbing up the ladder.

"Good or bad, I want regular reports Chips. Get Owen up and get him helping you."

"ah fuckin kay."

A loud ringing ping echoed through the steel hull of the boat. It hit them broadside, and passed through them. It rang off the opposite side of the hull and echoed back through the air to their ears. 

"Ah, and someone's fuckin' hunting us too!" Cursed Chips.

"Go!" Said Captain Percy. She left Chips digging out patch kits and her welding rig and went back up to the control room.

Hemi looked at her. "I guess they have no reason to fear giving away their position to us with an active sonar ping, since we have nothing to shoot at them." 

"Someday, Hemi, I'll make the _Prospect_ the first merchant sub with a torpedo tube just for you. Til then, we're just a small prey animal and our defense is to run and hide."

"There's no hiding for us right now. If you're back in the control room for the moment, I'll go down to sonar to keep tabs on them. How's the boat, by the way?"

"We're sinking. I put Chips on it." 

"Well, if she can patch the boat with expletives and downright pissed-offedness, we're in good shape then."


### Percy looks at the situation in the conn

"What's the state of my ship boys?" Captain Percy asked Gregory and Bastian.

"Apparently we're fucking sinking." Answered Gregory. 

"Apparently..." She agreed. She scanned the dials. There was nothing immediate in their impending doom. It was written instead in subtle ways across the dials, and when taken together. The dive plane angle was too steep for the amount of forward drive they were giving the boat. The trim tanks too light, the depth deeper than she wanted to be.

"Since they know where we are anyway, you might as well crank the bilge pumps up to maximum power. Better to make a bunch of noise than to sink."

Gregory flipped some switches and another frequency of vibration was added to the regular background hum from the motors propelling the boat.

"How's she handling generally?" Captain Percy asked.

"The boat just doesn't seem normal. It doesn't respond the way I want it to." Said Bastian.

"Here, let me try the rudder." Captain Percy turned the rudder wheel hard over. The _Prospect_ came about slowly but surely, she leaned over slightly, as she should, but then the whole boat leaned more sharply. Percy counter-steered and brought her back to the course they had been on.

"See? That doesn't seem quite OK to me." Said Bastian.

Captain Percy knew it was more than not OK. The delay before the sharp lean was the weight of the slack water in the bilge pouring over to one side of the boat and forcing her to lean.


### Percy goes to check on Chips' progress

"I... need to go check on Chips." She slid back down the ladder, patted Hemi on the back as she walked past him, and down the forward stairs to the cargo hold. Chips and Owen were at the far end, with bright work lamps rigged up. Owen was running a fat filthy hose for an old mobile bilge pump from the lake up the length of the cargo bay intending to connect it up to one of the trim tanks. Chips had a whole set of the grates out and stacked up. She was wearing thick rubber waders and standing directly on the inside of the pressure hull in the slick black water. The water had reached above the grating level and was almost to Chips chest, though she was not a very tall woman. She had heavy rubber welding gloves on, and a mask so she could see what she was doing under the water. When she lifted her head up for air, water ran down her mask in rivulets, and drained in a greasy gray stream from her thick braid of hair.

Captain Percy stood on the grating above her watching her latest attempt at welding shut the leak under the water. When she raised her head again Captain Percy asked her to report.

"Ah fuck ya, ya goddamn dominating twat. This is delicate work here, and it needs time. It's a'hundreds of tiny cracks, the hull splitted open the way ya might break off a piece of cheese --- with tiny cracks. If'n were one big crack t'would be much simpler."

Captain Percy spat, and her spit tasted oily and gritty to her, like the bilge water filling her boat. "Keep trying. I'm going to blow the tanks and bring us up though."

"Ah, fuckin smartest thing ya said yet this day, ya fucker. This course we're pursuin' right now is'na trackway to the gates 'a hell."


### Percy blows the tanks

Captain Percy headed back up the stairs to the control room. As she passed Hemi at the sonar she told him she was blowing the tanks. He nodded. "What about the sub following us?" He asked.

"We've crossed that line of risk, we're better off with them than down here now." She replied.

In the control room, she knelt down and opening a long thin toolbox bolted to the wall near the floor. From it she took a wrench as long as forearm, wrapped in a thick grease-stained rag. She fitted the end of it over a nut that was set in a fat pipe running along the wall.

"OK guys, I'm blowing the tanks." She warned the control room, and then turned the wrench until it was horizontal, aligned with the old pipe. Then she did it again with the sister pipe running just above it. A loud rush of moving air, under immense pressure, hissed through the pipe. All through the ship the sound of air pressing water out of the ship, changing the very mass of the ship itself.

"Take us up guys. Set the dive planes, and blow any trim tanks you haven't yet." Percy said to Gregory and Bastian. They turned the control wheels, the bow the of boat rose slowly, gently. Captain Percy looked across the dials. Once again they weren't reading what they should. Once again, something was wrong. "We're not going up fast enough..."

"We're not going up at all." Said Bastian. "Fuck me."

Percy went over each instrument, and the setting of each wheel in her head. "Hemi! She called down to him. "Hemi! We're not rising! The forward ballast didn't blow! They must have crushed the high pressure pipes when they rammed us."

Hemi looked up at her through his small glasses frames, his face only a few inches from the hatch opening because he was so large. "Captain Percy," he said, "I think we need to start thinking about more drastic measures to get us back on the surface."


### Percy blows the fuel ballast

"The fuel ballast?"

"Yes, I think we should dump the diesel at this point. Even if we get to the surface, we could lose the boat if the cargo bay keeps flooding and we can't figure out how to empty it. That's a bigger risk than not having enough fuel to get to port if we can manage to stay on the surface."

Captain Percy considered. But sometimes considerations are meaningless. They had passed the point of strategizing on how to evade their pursuers. For a submarine captain, the situation she now faced was the single biggest nightmare: get to the surface at any cost. Knowing that, the decision to blow out the fuel ballast tanks --- to dump all their diesel in the ocean --- was not even one that had to be made.

There were in fact two long thin toolboxes bolted to the wall. One had the tank blow wrench. The other was padlocked and contained the fuel ballast blow wrench. Captain Percy was the only person who carried the key to this second toolbox. She unlocked it and withdrew another wrapped wrench the same length as the tank blow wrench. But this one had a special 5-sided socket that would only fit the nut to open the air line into the fuel ballast tanks. As before, she fitted the wrench onto one air pipe, then the second, and another rush of high pressure air pushed through the ship. And their precious diesel fuel --- the only way to shore, was pushed out into the deep waters of the ocean.

"Now... now are we fucking rising?" Percy asked after a few minutes. But she was looking at the same gauges as everyone else. She could read them as well as anyone else.

Gregory was tentative. "We're... holding steady."

Owen, the youngest of the crew stuck his head up through the hatch while he stood on the ladder up to the control room. "Captain, Chips wants me to tell you that the cracks are splitting wider, and the flooding in the cargo bay is getting worse."

"Sweet fuck." Said Gregory.

"Can't we surface Captain?" Owen asked.

"Go back and help Chips. Do anything she asks of you."

"Alrighty." And Owen's head disappeared back from whence it came.


### Percy decides to head for the bottom

Percy was running out of ideas. It was easy when the only decision was to get to the surface at all costs while there still remained some levers to pull and options to engage. But now nothing remained that she could think of that would push them back towards the surface. She cleared her mind. The surface seemed so far away. The surface wasn't her natural environment anyway. Up there was war, borderlines, treaties, enforcers and authorities. Up there was conflict, nations, and bureaucracy. Underwater was where she belonged, where they were free to go where they liked, when they liked, by virtue of the exponentially huge amount of room provided by being able to move along the Z axis. Still, she had no desire to die down here. And no matter how safe and free underwater felt, there was always that yawning gulf under them, a black, cold, bottomless hell. Once you go _too_ far down, you go down forever. She wanted to be free, but she didn't want that.

She put the idea of the surface out of her mind. What if they did go down instead of up? What if they could find safety and respite in the deep?

She slipped down to the navigation and sonar compartment, where Hemi was still listening on the sonar headset. "Hemi, how deep is it here?"

"1000 meters, give or take. Essentially bottomless."

"Hmm." She went to the charts. The navigation station sat on top of a stack of flat files. Behind rolls of charts that were more commonly used were stacked between upright stakes. When they had the white lights on, the charts showed their age, yellowed and flaking at the edges. Hemi had their current position marked with a grease pencil on a glass sheet laying over the chart showing their position. The black smudges trailed up away from the shore they had left days before. They were in the goddamned middle of the ocean. It was a wasteland, far from any continental shelf or island that they could make it to on battery power alone, while slowly sinking. She pulled down a magnifier that hung from the ceiling by a retractable string. She looked closely at the grease markings on the chart, and the depth markings around them. "Hemi... come here." He put down the headphones, through which he was hearing nothing anyway and came over. She pointed to a spot on the map. "Figure out how to get us here. I'll be trying to eek out every ounce of buoyancy from my boat, and see how long we can last."

Hemi peered through the magnifier, and then pulled his slide rule from his pocket. He made some adjustments, some marks with the grease pencil on the glass, he touched his fingertips with the point of the pencil while muttering some numbers out loud. "I don't know if we can do it. Keep me informed of our exact depth, speed, and most importantly the rate we are sinking at."

Captain Percy smiled. "You keep me informed of the math." And climbed up to the control room.


### They make the run for the tablemount 

In the control room, Captain Percy gave Bastian and Gregory a new heading. "You guys have to do everything you can to keep us up, like gliding an airplane."

"What about our friendly local authority sub pursuing us? Won't they shoot?"

"We're too deep. They won't shoot. With our bilge pumps running flat out they can hear exactly where we are, and know we're in trouble. All they have to do is wait for us to sink or surface."

"How reassuring."

"Hemi!" Captain Percy called down through the hatch. "I want to go as fast as possible. How fast is possible?"

"What's the battery charge?"

"About two-thirds."

"I don't think you should push it beyond 10 knots. At that rate you'll run the batteries down to empty in two hours or so. We're going to need every minute of that two hours.

"Make it 10 knots Bastian." Bastian reached out a long skinny arm and adjusted the throttle controls until the speed indicated 10 knots.

Percy couldn't wait for Hemi. She started muttering her own equations to herself. "We're already almost 190 meters down. She's rated to 230 --- but that's without cracks in the pressure hull. We need to make it 20 nautical miles. The key question is: how fast are we sinking?"

"We really need to know how fast we're sinking." She said out loud. "Gregory, do you have any sense of it?"

"Well, barring us finding any reserve buoyancy, we're going down a couple of meters every nautical mile or so."

"That might be enough..." Captain Percy whispered to herself.


### staring at dials: depth vs the tablemount

Now it was nothing but staring at the dials. The wall of dials and gauges in front of them with their spindly little finger, all inching slowly one way or another depending on what they were tasked with. The individual parts the dials had to play all came together in a symphony that marked time towards their doom.

Nearly every gauge mattered to Captain Percy right now. Nearly every one represented  a variable in the equation that controlled whether they lived or died: speed, battery charge, battery drain rate, the status of the trim tanks, course, rudder, ship angle, dive plane angle... everything mattered. But as in every equation some variables weighed more than others. The two that mattered most to Captain Percy right now were the depth of ship gauge (which mattered in every submarine maneuver of course) and depth under keel (which told them how far the ocean bottom was under them, and rarely mattered in a submarine maneuver).

The depth of the boat was slowly, slowly creeping downwards. She stared at the black line of the needle on the dial, and willed it to stay still. She was pretty sure Gregory and Bastian were doing the same. But it never stopped its shaky wavering, and it persistently wavered towards the deep end of the dial. It had already crept three quarters of the way around the dial --- on a dial that was graduated in such a way that the far end, where its tiny steel bounding needle poked up, was beyond the capabilities of what the ship could survive.

They had watched it travel that distance the way one might track a long journey on a map. It seemed they had traveled interminably far to get where they were, and they looked back at the three quarters of the dial they had passed the way the way one remembers days and days on the road in a long cross-country journey. But in actual physical distance, it was no more than one might walk in a few minutes to buy a bottle of milk from the store.

But the gauge that mattered most to Captain Percy right now was that depth under keel gauge. The instrumentation that fed that gauge was only so sensitive. It could show the depth of the bottom far beyond what the submarine was capable of, but nowhere near the depths of the deep ocean. At the far end of that dial, it's bounding gauge was cutely labeled, in an ancient naval tradition, "Bottomless." 
And it really did not matter that somewhere down there might be an actual bottom. For this sub, for their pursuing sub, for any submarine that Captain Percy had ever heard about, the deep ocean was in all practical ways a never-ending depth. Anything that went down there could never find a bottom, and could never come back up. They lived much of their submariner lives floating on delicate bubbles of gas over that black hole that always wanted to suck them down.  The needle of the depth under keel dial had been pegged at "Bottomless" for days now as they have been crossing deep ocean.

Hemi came up through the hatch into the control room with a clipboard and a pencil, and leaned over the glowing red dials, raising his little glasses with his fingers to bring them into sharper focus. He jotted readings off the dials down on his clipboard. 

Captain Percy fished her hand around among the joists that supported the pressure hull wall, and found a rumpled pack of cigarillos. She shook one out and lit it. "Are we going to make it Hemi?"

"It's fucking razor work Captain. Numbers slide past numbers, and decimal points worth of differences change whether we live or die here... and if the numbers work out in our favor, there's no saying whether, should your plan succeed initially, that it doesn't simply perpetrate the complete failure of the pressure hull and doom us all anyway."

"I'm entirely open to other ideas here." This elicited dead silence in the control room. "Alright then we keep pushing those numbers then. In a matter of an hour or so, we'll know whether our fates have been pinched off, or granted a short stay longer on this sea of ours." She sucked slowly on her cigarillo.

A third gauge now entered as a heavy variable in Captain Percy's equation: the clock. The fact that they other gauges all moved so slowly, and the clock moved quickly and steadily did not provide a sense of relief. 

She stared intently at the clock, willing it to move slower. Her eyes wandered back and forth from it to the depth-under-keel gauge, where she stared at the needled and summoned all the metaphysical powers of the universe to move the needle up off the "Bottomless" pin. She thought she saw it writhe for a split instant, like the flash of a small bait fish seen catching the sun in a shallow pool of water. 

She stood and took a rag from a hook and reached over Gregory to wipe the condensing droplets of water off the glass of the gauge, then circled around the aging pitted chrome casing for good measure. She could feel the little spots of rust and degrading metal catching against the fibers of the rag. She tapped the glass with her finger.


### They land on the tablemount

And the needle moved.

It just wavered, hovered for a second above the pin, and then returned to resting wearily on the pin. But it had definitely moved. Her eyes went back to the clock, more minutes passed. To their speed: steady at 10 knots. To their battery charge: painfully low. To their depth: too deep for comfort.

But the depth-under-keel needle moved again, rising up and falling back, like a dying crone trying to raise herself for one last curse at her hated relations. And again. And then it was wavering unsteadily above the "Bottomless" pin. The gap between the needle and the pin was tenuous, but real. The bottom was coming up under them.

Captain Percy reached above her head for a strap. "Drive boys, Drive." The bottom was still far far below them, so far down that if the boat went down now the _Prospect_ would be crushed into nothing but a greasy stain on that bottom. But it was at least a measurable distance now instead of an unknowable nothingness.

Minutes later the depth-under-keep gauge started rising steadily, like it had intention. It gave the impression that they were moving quickly, though in fact their speed remained steady, while the slope of the bottom had drastically increased, and was rapidly rising under them, a sheer undersea mountain wall. The depth-under-keel needle rose shockingly fast, in a way that might give the impression they were about to smack into a mountainside, from which they would slide helplessly back into the black pit. Instead, the needle shot up and back to 250 meters, and then stayed hovering at that level.

"OK Gregory, now the fucking stupid part: give me a gentle dive plane down angle."

"You want to go _down_?"

"Down Gregory. Now. Take us to the bottom."

The dive plane wheel slipped through Gregory's grimey fat hands, and the bow of the boat eased downwards. Captain Percy pressed the collision alarm button and a klaxon blaired through the ship. She pulled the boat PA mic down from the array of radio mics hanging from the ceiling and pressed the talk button. "Chips: leave the leak and you and Owen get out of the cargo hold, and seal the bulkheads behind you. We're going to bottom the boat, and there's a reasonable chance it will split our wound wide open."

At the sound of the collision alarm Hemi came up through the hatch. His eyes passed over the gauges taking in their situation. "Gently Gregory." He almost whispered.

"Yes fucking gently." Followed up Percy, "as gentle as you've ever been, like you're laying down a fevered child. Bastian, disengage the motor. Lets use only what's left of our forward momentum, and let our leaking boat take us down the way she wants to."

Slowly, slowly, the depth gauge needle turned to the right as the boat sank. Slowly, slowly, the depth-under-keep gauge turned to the left as the bottom rose. The depth gauge showed 250 meters. The depth-under-keel gauge came to rest on its other limit pin, labeled '0'. And at that moment the whole boat trembled as the bow touched the bottom. Captain Percy felt the slight angle under her feet relax as the stern came down slowly and rested on the bottom too.

"Jeesus." Said Bastian. "The fucking bottom. At 250 meters! On a undersea mountain top, landed like fucking Noah."

"Technically a tablemount." Said Hemi. "A relatively flat surface worn down from an ancient volcano. And yes, if you like, very much antediluvian."

"Deeper than she's rated for," added Percy, "but not by much. If the pressure hull holds, we have bought ourselves a little time. But it's just as fucking likely that the cargo bay is now completely split open and we will die here. So don't get your hopes up."

"As a bonus, we'll blend in with the bottom on sonar. Our pursuing friends will not be able to see us, and will likely assume we sank." Said Hemi.

"Which, we in fact did," added Percy "and I would not be the one to correct their thinking that we will never rise to the surface again."


### Repairs on the bottom

It was time for Captain Percy to survey the damage. She got on the ship PA and told Chips to meet her at the entrance to the cargo bay, before slipping down the ladder and heading down there herself.

Percy found Chips waiting for her at the bulkhead entrance to the cargo bay in the forward battery room on the bottom deck of the boat. Chips had a large wrench with her and as soon as Percy arrived she banged with it on the bulkhead. "Well Capt, it soundser fuckin hollah to me. Still air on the other side of the bulkhead a' leasts."

Percy nodded and cranked open the rusting sealing wheel, which squeaked painfully in her ears. The lights were out in the cargo bay, so they were looking into blackness, but the air smelled wet, which disturbed both of them instinctively and immediately. Percy reached around and flipped on the lights. The white overheads glared down on her cargo bay. The steel grating led down a very gently slope into an oily, black subterranean lake that was filling the lower front part of her cargo hold. A couple of empty wooden crates floated like lost viking craft on it. The sound echoed through the giant empty space and over the water. A film of black frothing grease floated in patches on it.

"That's a'fuckin nightmare." Said Chips.

"Fuck. We probably did more damage to her when we pressed her bow into the bottom. Like levering apart the bones of a fowl. We don't have much time. What do you need Chips?"

"Ah just feckin send Owen back down. An it looks like ay'll be breathin through a feckin hose while I'm doin' the stitchin' back t'gether now."

"Fuckin' alright Chips. I'll get Gregory and Bastian looking for some more portable bilge pumps, run some hose down and see if we can't get some of this water into the trim tanks and back out into the ocean where it belongs."

"Feck yas."

### Percy goes back upstairs, rouses the boys, gets coffee

Percy headed back up to the control room. She found Gregory and Bastian crawling into their bunks in crew quarters having been released from control duty by Hemi. Their eyes were slitted and bleary and they were not being entirely successful in their attempts to climb into their racks.

"Come'on dickwads, you can't sleep yet. Get some coffee and then go find some portable bilge pumps. We need to get this boat pumped out, or you'll never wake up from yer little beauty naps."

She left them groaning and headed to the galley, thinking coffee sounded like a good idea. There was a tin cup sitting upside down in the drying rack. It was one of those blue tin cups with the white flecks. The outside of it had been dipped in rubber as a way to market the cups to submariners. Those cups always tasted unpleasantly like metal to Percy. This one was relatively clean, just the usual semi-permanent coffee stains. The coffee in the pot had been in there on the warmer for hours. Maybe days, who knew. She poured it into her cup and added a couple of scoops of sugar. The taste was foul, like what she always imagined "sweet crude" must taste like. Her tastebuds rebelled, but the rest of her body knew better, and she felt immediately better.

There situation was dire. They were still terribly unlikely to survive this. If being flooded and bottomed had been the worst thing that happened today, she would have been upset. But somehow the relative safety they had now compared to where they had been an hour before, slowly sinking over a black gulf, made her feel surprisingly relaxed. Relaxed enough to enjoy a cup of burnt coffee at least.


### Percy talks to Hemi about surviving their immediate futures

Percy found another relatively clean tin cup in the dish cabinet and filled it with coffee. She brought it to Hemi at the navigation station.

Hemi took the cup and held it to his lips blowing the burnt smell off the surface. His glasses steamed up. "Chips have the leak under control?"

"Eh. It's deep under water now. She's going to have to dive down there to weld it."

"Fuck."

"That's right."

"Even if we get it sealed, even if we can manage to pump out, even if we get to the surface, it doesn't look good. We're nowhere right now, and of course we have no fuel or battery."

"Still'd rather be there than here."

"I'm just trying to get ahead of the problem. We're in a situation where we need to overcome a whole series of challenges, each in their particular order. It would be the ignorant motherfucker who doesn't think ahead."

"And you think I'm that ignorant motherfucker? You keep doing the thinking ahead Hemi. You let me know if I'm not considering something that impacts our future survivability. But otherwise I need to focus on surviving our situation right now. And that currently means getting some of this foul black water out of my boat."

He nodded and she patted his huge tweedy shoulder. 


### repairing and pumping out the cargo hold

Back through the crew quarters and down the steep flight of steel stairs into the cargo hold. Bastian and Gregory were laying out heavy cloth-covered hoses down the center of the cargo bay and hooking them up to portable electric bilge pumps the size of small refrigerators.

Owen had his own electric pump, a smaller one, and was feeding an air hose to Chips who was in water over her head with a welding torch in one hand and wearing a diving mask that was connected to the air host. The welding torch was connected by hoses to welding tanks in a rack with wheels propped at the shore of the lake filling the cargo bay.

Chips dove down and there was a quiet moment before a hot blue light lit up the black lake from under the surface, wavered for a for moments, and then died away. This repeated a few times before Chips' head broke back through the surface. She ripped off the diving mask. "Own! I need another piece of steel plate, and another brace."

"Alrighty Chips!" Called the kid from the shore. Owen was wearing the same greasy-slick rubber waders Chips had had on earlier. He selected some metal bits from a pile of scraps piled on the grating next to the welding tanks and waded into the foul bilge to hand them to Chips.

Every sound in the cargo bay echoed back and forth off the exposed steel inner side of the pressure hull. That was normal, and Captain Percy was used to it. What really ate at her instincts though was the way the pool of water filling one end of the cargo bay changed the sound. It was hard to pin down precisely how it changed. It sounded like a room with a pool for athletics. It was a quality of sound that should never be heard on a submarine.

She sipped her coffee and watched Chips dive again with her plates in one hand. More blue light from under the water. Percy had an idea to go and track down a meter stick and prop it in the water, so they could all see when the water started to lower. But then thought better of that, considering the strong possibility of the water quickly rising over the top of the stick.

Instead she helped Gregory and Bastian get the bilge hoses connected to the trim tanks and got them cranking. The hoses inflated with the pressure of the water running up the gentle grade from the pumps. She could hear it pouring into the empty trim tanks.


### Percy inspects the damage

While Chips was on shore trying to find a particular patch piece she wanted in the scrap pile, Percy took the mask and waded into the water to get a good look at the damage. The water was the freezing-cold and never-changing temperature of deep-ocean water. The water had picked up an unpleasant array of smells though, a mix of petro-chemicals and solvents, refuse, and old grease --- the stuff that always contaminated a boat's bilge, but lifted up by the sheer volume of water to Percy's face. 

The damage was bad. As Chips had said earlier, it wasn't one big split in the metal, it was a long string of side-by-side cracks. She put her hand out in front of her mask, holding it over the cracks, and she could feel the onrush of the icy water pressing against her warm flesh. Chips' patches were pieces of curved steel that she was welding into place over the cracks. Chips was no expert at underwater welding, and the welds were globulous and imprecise. It was starting to look like a mess, but Percy didn't know what else she could do. She climbed back out of the water shivering and dripping oily droplets that clung together unnaturally. Percy always thought of herself as pretty tough. But in many ways Chips, with her foul language and bad attitude, was a lot tougher. Chips had never even mentioned the temperature of the water.

With the extra bilge pumps running she let Gregory and Bastian go stumble up to their racks to lie down. They slept through the next six hours or so of work while she, Owen, and Hemi did whatever they could to help Chips get the hull welded back together. Patching the boat was the only thing that mattered right now, and Chips was the only one who could do the welding. Percy, Hemi, and Owen found themselves standing around smoking and drinking coffee more than actually helping, so Percy sent Hemi and Owen to their racks too.

Percy needed sleep more than anyone, but she knew there was no way she could sleep. Maybe, maybe once they got to the surface. She smoked up one cigarillo after cup of coffee after cigarillo. When Chips needed something she was there, but mostly Chips had her own method and didn't really want any help. When Chips disappeared below the surface it became totally silent in the cargo bay. Percy looked at her watch --- where time had been so relentless before, now it barely moved. Because of that it took her maybe more than an hour to realize that the water level had receded a bit, leaving an greasy black line on the pressure hull marking its high-water mark.

Now Percy let herself have some small amount of hope. The water level going down was everything. The boat didn't need power, or the high-pressure air system, or a running motor to reach the surface --- all the needed was that water level to go down, physics would take care of everything else.

She waited for Chips to raise her head above the surface again. "Chips! The water level is dropping!" Percy shouted to her, while pointing at the black line of grit on the pressure hull.

"Ah feckin sure. I've patched so much is 'bout feckin time."

"I have to go up to the control room --- there's really no way to know when we'll get buoyant again, and someone has to be there if we do."

"Ah!" Chips gruffed. She waved a hand and disappeared back under the surface.


### Percy back in the control room; staring at dials again

As Captain Percy passed through the crew quarters she shook the kid Owen awake again. "I have to go to the control room. Go down and watch Chips and make sure she doesn't die." Percy knew it would be incredibly stupid to let someone, even someone as tough as Chips, do underwater welding without someone keeping an eye out.

Owen didn't say anything but resignedly rolled out of his rack to his feet, and rubbed his eyes before heading back down to the cargo bay.

Percy climbed up into the control room and sat at one of the maneuvering stations. The familiar dials and gauges once again spread out in front of her. The readings hadn't changed at all since she last left them, obviously. She looked around, and it was a moment before she realized that she would know the boat was rising before any of the gauges showed it. The water was being drained out so slowly that it wasn't like the boat would just pop off the bottom. She would feel the slight incline it had taken on settling into the bottom come off first. The boat righting itself would be the first indication it was rising, and she didn't need gauges for that.

She returned to her feet, fished her control-room cigarillo back from its nook in the wall and lit up. With nothing that mattered to look at, she started pacing unconsciously back and forth. How long now? She looked at her watch, but realized as soon as she did that that particular gauge didn't really matter either.

She glanced over at the control gauges and just as she did, she saw the angle-of-the-boat gauge waver slightly back and forth in its little glass tube. Ah! She was wrong. The gauges might know first! But seconds later she did feel it. The deck under her feet changed inclination every so slightly, She reached up and grabbed a strap, and then the whole boat lifted ever so slightly towards level.

"Fuck me! The trim tanks!" Percy remembered they had been pumping bilge water into them, but that water was still physically still inside the boat. She noted there was reasonable pressure still in the high-pressure system and reached over to the ballast panel and opened the valve that would blow out the trim tanks full of bilge water.

There was the usual loud hiss, a moment passed, and then the bow of the boat jumped off the bottom, followed quickly by the stern. The depth-under-keel gauge snapped up to two meters. She could hear suddenly-wakened crew members cursing loudly up at her from the crew quarters. She grabbed the boat PA mic "Fellows! We have positive fuckin' bouancy!"


### A fight with Chips

Up instead of down felt great. A relief in the change of environmental motion that only someone who has acutely attuned themselves to three-dimensional space could experience. 

As soon as Percy had blown out the trim tanks, there was no stopping her. It was a slow rise, weighted as she was by the tons of extra weight in water still sloshing around in the cargo hold. It was nothing like the violent rise that an emergency blow would illicit had the _Prospect_ been functioning normally. But they were steadily rising.

Hemi popped up in the control room and stood watching the gauges, smiling a quiet smile of intellectual satisfaction. 

"Hemi, don't just stand there like a fuckin' idiot." Percy said to him. "Sit at the controls and make sure nothing stupid happens." Hemi nodded and slipping into a control chair made some adjustments to the dive planes while Percy balanced the trim tanks so they didn't go bow up.

A banging and cursing came up to them through from the crew quarters, and a second later Chips climbed up into the control room, leaving a small puddle of black water at the base of the ladder, and a thin trail of the foul stuff behind her as she walked up to Percy. She was holding a length of steel bracing pipe in her hand.

"Ah ya feckin' stupid twat, ya almos' killed me! Wha fuckd stupid idea came to yer hed to blow the trem tanks with no warnin to me? I was feckin washed half-way down the 'old!"

"Oh fuck me." Said Percy, realizing her deadly mistake. "Fuck me!" In all they had been through since the black sub rammed them, this was the first time she felt real panic. It was true: she could easily have killed Chips.

"Ya feck yoursef!" Chips was red and as angry as Captain Percy had ever seen that little perpetually pissed-off imp. Chips had no tolerance for stupidity in general, but when it was a matter where stupidity might get someone killed, she got ripshit. She kept raising the pipe in her hand like she was going to move it up to a position to take a swing at Percy.

Percy put up one hand. "Put the fucking pipe down Chips. You're absolutely right, I made a mistake. We're in a dangerous fucking business, you know that."

"If'n I go down that's my fate, but I'll feckin damn you from the beyond, I'll feckin come back and feckin _haunt_ the feckin shadows of your remainin' life if'n is cuz of stupid feckin twat-brain moves liken that!"

"It won't happen again, Chips. I promise you that. I fucking need you! That hole in my boat isn't wholly patched yet, and we're not going to make it to a place where it can be fixed unless you can keep this boat together." This appeal to her necessity softened Chips a bit. It was just so obviously true. They were doomed without Chips. They might be doomed anyway, but surely doomed without Chips. "Give me the pipe, Chips." Chips handed her the pipe. "Go lay down. She'll hold together long enough for you to get a bit of rest now."

"Naa. Yer feckin right --- the patch needs more werk. I'm heading back down to the cargo bay."

"Don't do anything stupid on account of lack of fucking rest --- that isn't on me."

Chips nodded and backed slowly down the ladded out of the control room.

"We all need rest Capt." Said Hemi.

"Welp, we make it to the surface, and if we can _stay_ on the surface, y'all can take a little nap."

"That sounds better than a week's pay right now."


### Surfaced

The _Prospect_ climbed slowly upwards. It tilted a little on one axis, then the other as Captain Percy adjusted the trim of the tanks, but more or less the boat rose straight up, since they didn't have the motors running and it was pure buoyancy alone that lifted it.

Percy and Hemi watched the depth gauge slowly roll itself backwards, up past their test depth, up into what Percy would normally consider safe operating depth, then periscope depth, and then the sail broke through the surface. The guys in the crew quarters could feel the boat bob like a cork to the surface, and they all cheered and ran to the bottom of the ladder up to the control room, obviously expecting to be allowed out on deck.

At first, Captain Percy wasn't even going to think about allowing that. Years of experience had ground into her the notion that you don't surface a sub and not look around before popping open hatches. There was always a chance that the only safe move was to dive right back down. But she fought back this instinct within herself --- there was nothing on the surface that could be more dangerous than attempting to dive her damaged boat again. She looked down at her crew and waved them up through the control room.

Owen, with his scrawny youthful energy, led the way and charged up the ladder, struggled with the tightly closed (and somewhat rusted) hatch-seal wheel for a moment before it squeakingly eased open and then pushed the hatch open.

On a submarine, one never seriously realizes how stale and still the air can be until a moment like this. Daylight poured down through the hatch into the control room below. With it came cool, moving air. It was air that smelled of the open sea instead of human bodies, oil, and diesel exhaust. The entire crew followed Owen out onto the bridge.

It was a cool mildly breezy day. Gray clouds hung low overhead, and there was a mild chop on the water. It couldn't be more perfect, as far as they were concerned. Owen climbed over the fairing and down the rungs on the side of the sail to the main deck and ran up and down it shrieking like a small child. 

"Hemi, you were looking at the charts, who controls this part of the surface these days?" Percy asked.

"Umm, maybe the Western Federated Socialists? At least, they did the last time I looked at a Territorial Authorities map. But that was more than a year ago."

"Those assholes are bad news, and have no tolerance for surface transports --- even when they have papers." Put in Bastian. "We should not stay here."

"We would be on our way... if we had any fuel or power. That lovely sound you hear of gentle waves smacking against our hull is the sound of a boat not moving. We're dead in the water, and We're still a bit fucked folks."

"Owen!" She called down to the deck. "Get back up here, we have to get back to work." As he ran over and started climbing back up the side of the sail she gave orders. "Chips, take Owen and get back down to your patch. Make it as tight as you can. We have to get it sealed up before our batteries die completely and we can't pump any more water out of the bilge.

"Hemi, get down to the navigation chart and see if there's any hope of any place we could limp to with what battery we have left.

"Bastian, get on the radio and see if you can raise anyone on the Independent Operators frequency. Maybe we'll get extraordinarily fucking lucky and find some help from someone who won't ask to many questions."

"Or try to sink us." Hemi put in.

"Ya. Bastian: if you do raise anyone don't actually talk to them. And don't _tell_ them anything. Just come get me and I'll try to gauge their reliability myself."

"Sure Capt." Said Bastian.

"Gregory... I'm starving, want to see if you can something going in the galley?"

"Sounds good boss."

"And put a new pot of coffee on too. The shit in there now has been on that burner so long it looks like bunker fuel."

Chips had already taken Owen back down below, and the rest of them now followed them down, but left the hatch open and for the next few hours a blessed breeze blew down through the control room and reached occasional tendrils of sea air as far into the boat as the crew quarters.


### On the radio

Inside the sub, Percy joined Hemi at the navigation table.

"The most pressing problem" said Hemi, not even waiting for her to ask, "is the batteries are almost gone. Even running extremely judiciously, we have a range of a few nautical miles at best." He used a compass to draw a dotted line around their position showing what was within range. It was a completely barren section of the chart. The middle of the ocean. It was nowhere.

"Not even close huh? Well, that just leaves help from someone."

"Most folks in these neglected waters are not much inclined to help those they don't know."

"We'll just have to hope we don't meet most fuckin' folks then."

She headed up to the control room to see how Bastian was doing with that goal. He had one stick-arm up in the air, adjusting some dials on the radio mounted in the ceiling of the control room. His other hand held the mic that was attached by a curling wire to the radio. He was giving out mayday requests on a couple of different frequencies known to be monitored by other independent shipping operators like themselves, both legitimate transporters and smugglers. But those frequencies were also monitored by Authority vessels that might be engaged in policing shipping and transport traffic. 

"Anything Bastch?"

"Nothing. Nothing good or bad. This is one empty piece of ocean you raised us in."

"Alright, I'm gonna check sonar. Maybe someone's listening who just isn't interested in responding."

She slid back down the ladder and at the sonar station lifted the headphones over her ears. She didn't bother sitting, but stood turning the control wheel with one hand, slowly back and forth, scanning for the sound of anything made by humans. One nice thing about being dead in the water was they weren't making any noise themselves. She could hear even the small waves against the hull of the _Prospect_. It was a rare pleasure to have such clean and uncompromised sound. But for all that silence, there wasn't much to hear.

Except... way off their rear port side. A very soft throbbing. It was faint and threaded, like the last heartbeats of a leviathan.

She called Hemi over. "Listen to this, and tell me what it is."

Hemi had excellent ears for sonar. He put the headphones on and closed his eyes.

"Small surface craft... unusual though. It seems like it has almost no hull sound. I don't really hear any wake running along it."

"Can you calculate a range?"

"Ya, it's close. Let's see." He looked at the dials of the sonar unit and scribbled some numbers on a scrap paper. "2 nautical miles, thereabouts maybe? I think you should be able to see them with the scope."

Percy nodded and climbed back up into the control compartment. She raised the periscope up and spun it around to the bearing of the target. She scanned slowly back and forth along the horizon line, where the dark gray of the water press-fit up against the light gray of the sky. With the _Prospect_ on the surface, and the scope up, she could see something like ten nautical miles on a clear day. This was as good as vision ever got on a submarine.

"Even if it were a fucking canoe... at two miles away I should be able to see it." There was nothing but unblemished gray fields in her scope. She double-checked the bearing with Hemi. She was pointed in the right direction, there was simply nothing there. 

She had a hunch though. She felt confident about the sonar target. She was sure something was there despite the fact that underwater sound can sometimes play tricks. The lack of any visual on the surface narrowed down the possibilities of what it could be.

"Hemi, I want to motor over closer to it."

"What ever it is, it's fucking small. Even if we find something, and even if they are friendly, there might not be much the can do to help us."

"Taking fucking risks has got us this far, Hem. Stay here on sonar and track it."

Captain Percy put Bastian back in the control seat. She gave him a heading towards the sonar target and they put the electric motors in gear. Her eyes locked on the battery gauge, which waved slightly as the motors started turning, drawing amperage out of there depleted battery banks. The needles on the battery gauges were already in the red. There was such a very little gap of air between them and the zero mark. They would only get one shot at this. 


### Ship-to-ship

They were creeping --- two nautical miles an hour. Going very slow would preserve the battery power longer. After a quarter hour or so, Hemi called up from sonar, "We got lucky Percy, I'm tracking something like an intercept course. At this rate there's no way we would ever have caught them, if they were heading away from us. But..." There was a gap, and Percy could hear him scratching a pencil on paper. "But, we need to go slightly faster, can you do four knots?"

Percy sighed. It didn't sound like much, but it was twice as much power consumption. "You heard the man Bastian, give her a little gas."

There was a burning cigarette between Bastian's bony fingers as they wrapped around the throttle and eased it slightly forward.

Ten minutes later Hemi called up, "That's good. We'll be within a quarter mile of it in a few minutes."

"They must be able to see us. They haven't changed direction or speed?"

"Nope. They must not be looking, or they just don't care."

Captain Percy stayed on the periscope, scanning slowly back and forth across the bearing. Still nothing.

"Shit!" Called up Hemi. "They're gone. No more sound."

"Stop the boat Bastian." The electric motors were very quiet when running this slow, but she wanted Hemi to have total silence for listening. "What was the last range?"

"About 500 meters. They're super close. We could ping them?"

"Ah, that would fucking scare the shit out of them. They might think we were armed and about to fire on them. We're trying to make friends here. ...I'm going to try ship-to-ship radio, we're just close enough they might hear us, and that might be a little less threatening."

Percy reached over her head and flipped on the ship-to-ship radio. It wasn't really a radio, it was just acted like one. It used the sonar rig to push sound through the water to talk to other ships nearby. 500 meters was just about the limit of its range. Real radio transmissions were supposed to follow a set of protocols and rules, potentially enforced by Authorities in their territories. Ship-to-ship had no rules other than an informal argot that had developed partially to obfuscate meaning for any other ship that might be listening, and partially just out of habit.

Captain Percy took down the mic from the radio and brought it to her mouth. She pushed the transmit button, and the needles on the gauges on the radio jumped to show how much power she was transmitting with. She whistled a series of five tones into the mic, and let go of the transmit button. The power needles died back to zero, and there was silence for a minute or two. Then she repeated the transmission of the tones. Another minute passed.

Then a crackly male voice came over the radio. "I see you over there, you hulking ugly gray submarine. And I guess you know I'm here. Why are ya sittin' on the fuckin surface, and what the fuck ya want with me?"

Percy hesitated, and then transmitted back. "Well, first let me say we're nothing but a transport sub, and we're unarmed. Second, we've been severely damaged, and walked through an icy hell to get back to the surface. We're out of fuel and extremely low on power. Long and short is that we're in some desperate need of help, and you are the only contact we've seen in these empty waters."

Another moment passed. "Yea. Well. These waters are empty because the Authorities running this territory right now are a bunch of tight-sphinctered aholes who seem more interested in shooting down transports than letting any commerce commence. It's a bad place to be not moving on the surface."

"Not movin' is hardly fuckin' typical for us. What cha got there? Any assistance you can offer would be much appreciated."

"Ehh, I'm not one who much for offering assistance, but if yer telling the truth, your sitch seems pretty dire."

"I know that's kinda a risk for you to take. Anything I can do to reassure you we aren't anything other than we say we are?"

"The territorial Authority motherfuckers around here generally just shoot first, check papers later. They're not much for mind games. So I think I can risk pulling alongside ya, and poppin' the hatch. Don't send nobody onto my boat without my sayso, or I'll dive straight out from under ya, got it?"

"Alrighty, we'll look for ya off the port side. Out."


### Shakes pulls alongside

"Hemi," Percy called down to sonar, "we've got ourselves something, though I'm not sure what. You and Bastian come up on deck with me."

Bastian unfolded his long skinny limbs from the control chair and climbed up the ladder and up through the sail hatch with Percy and Hemi following. The wind was blowing a little harder now and the chop had kicked up a bit. Bastian cupped his hands and lit another cigarette. Percy and Hemi shaded their eyes, scanning the water. It was a few minutes before they saw a small gray oblong object cutting through the choppy little waves. It was a tiny submarine sail, no more than a meter long and high, with a couple of thin whispy antennas trailing from the top in the wind. Unusual for a submarine sail, it had a small view port in the front of it through which the pilot could look. At the rear of the sail a thin stream of diesel smoke floated up and away behind it. The deck of the small sub was totally awash, running just at the surface of the water.

As it got closer they could see the big splotchy patches of rust all along the hull of the mini-sub, and a slight oil slick of a trail that it left behind in its very minimal wake. Bastian, Hemi, and Percy climbed over the fairing of the sail of the _Prospect_ and down to the deck. Standing here, Percy was discomforted to see the bow of her boat sitting much lower in the water than usual, still weighted down by the tons of excess ballast water.

A hatch opened at the top of the sail of the mini-sub and a head of a man with spiked yellow hair emerged. His arms were still below inside the sail working controls and he was standing propped on something so he could see as he guided the boat alongside the _Prospect_. Bastian opened a wet-storage hatch on the deck and pulled out some large white rubber bumpers, each with a long line that he tied off on cleats welded to the deck and lowered down between the two subs.

"Toss a line!" The guy in the sail said as he let the engine run on idle and climbed up over the fairing. He was wearing rubbers boots as he ran up along the washed deck. They were pulled over black leather pants that were cracked and gray at the seams and joints. From the left side of his ancient brown leather belt hung a couple of sizes of adjustable wrenches, the finish on the them beat away from years of use and banging into each other on his belt, like chimes, so they were matte in color and rusting in places. He wore a worn black denim vest from which the sleeved had been inexpertly removed, leaving stray threads of denim.

Bastian, still with a cigarette between his lips, threw across a line and made it fast to a recessed cleat in the hull of the mini-sub, and then repeated the move at the stern. He nimbly leaped across to the hand-holds on the side of the _Prospect_ and climbed up the curving side to the deck.


### Intro Shakes

He looked around with some nervous twitching, and then motioned to Bastian for a cigarette, who cupped his hand and lit it off his own before handing it to the man.

The man took the cigarette in a hand that shook slightly when he reached out, and brought it to his lips and sucked long and hard at it. "Ah fuck thanks. I ran out a couple of days ago. I go by Shakes." He held up his hand in front of them and they could see it tremble slightly in the air. "Ya can see why."

"That's a hell of a craft ya got there Shakes." Said Hemi.

"Like it? I built it my fuckin self. Welded it together on the top of a mountain from scraps. On a coffee farm, they had a bunch of land higher up where the coffee don't grow, and it seemed like a good place to build a boat. It was. Cept it wasn't a good place to launch a boat from. Getting it down to the water was more difficult than the buildin'."

"I've heard of this kind of thing," said Percy, "run fast and just below the surface. Basically invisible to any kind of radar, and too quiet for most sonar. Good for... small shipments?"

"Ay, 'Specialty shipments' --- when stuff has to be got somewhere fast with no questions asked. Just not too much stuff. I alsa have a few special modifications, this here ship is best in class!" Hemi looked doubtfully at the rusting bulbous hulk alongside. "Most of these kinds of homemade jobs just run at the surface, I added some batteries and some trim tanks, and this here boat, the _Gnat_ is the name, can _dive_. Run a bit under water, just enough to get away from any curious Authorities."

"How deep?" Asked Hemi.

"Maybe 30 meters on a good day. You don't have to go very deep to hide in something so small."

"How fast?" Hemi's curiosity was peaked now.

Shakes grinned. "Faster than this tub." He said kicking the toe of his rubber boot against the hull of the _Prospect_. 

Percy frowned. "That's pretty impressive there, but have any of you got any ideas how this is going to help get my boat moving? You ain't carrying a load of diesel fuel are ya Mr. Shakes?"

"Can't say as I am. And I can't say what I _am_ carrying, ceptin that I can't see how any of it could help you. Still, if I can do anything to help, I'm game. I'm pretty convinced y'all ain't some Authority ruse, and we smugglers gotta stick together I say."

"We're not smugglers." Said Percy, her eye firmly locked on Shakes'. "We're independent logistics operators."

"Ain't we all!" Said Shakes. "Honestly, I ain't got much in the way of ideas for ya. I was thinking maybe you was the smart ones. From what I can see y'all are fuckin' fucked. Best I can say is I could run into where I'm headin' and send some friendly bigger boat back out for ya. But that'll probably take a couple of days."


### they find out about the depot from Shakes

"In a couple of days we'll either be sunk or in an Authority holding cell. There's gotta be a better option. Hemi?"

"Well, nothing immediately comes to mind. But that's with limited information. If we have a new option, it will be aboard the _Gnat_, but to sort that out, I'll have to get in there and take a look at what resources you've got Shakes. I'm not sure how willing ya are to let me do that."

Shakes didn't say anything, but pulled on his cigarette and watched the exhaled smoke quickly pulled out over the water by the breeze.

"Mind if we ask where yer headed Shakes?" Asked Percy

"Ay, I was about to fuckin say anyway: there's a mid-sea depot about 100 miles from here. It's just over the line in the waters of a different Authority, somewhat more permissive, bit more friendly to commerce. That's why the Authority on this side of the line are such a bunch of aggressive motherfuckin' assholes though --- they don't want shit running through here to there. If you can get this tub of yers to the depot, you can definitely get fuel there, and probably some poorly executed and overpriced repairs as well."

"Sounds like a goddamn Eden." Said Percy. "Look, we aren't the type to ask for help, and I hate imposin' on other fuckin' folks business, just as I don't want 'em imposing on mine. But you can see we're more than a little desperate here. If you can allow Hemi --- and just Hemi --- aboard to take some specs of your boat, see if you're carrying anything he can use, we'll make it up to you at the depot. ...though honestly at the moment about all we can offer you is hot food."

Shakes eyes brightened at that. "Hrm. Well I ain't been eating nothing but cold chow straight from the can for days now. A hot meal is a strong offer yer puttin on the fuckin' table there. Alright. This big guy, and this big guy alone. And he don't look at nothing I don't want him to look at, and he don't get answers to no questions I don't want to answer. No pushin, right?"

"No pushing." Said Hemi.

"Right. Hang back a minute, let me go look around in there first, make sure all my pornography is put away."

Percy grinned as Shakes lowered himself down the side and leapt nimbly over the dangerous gap between the two boats. He disappeared into the sail hatch of the _Gnat_.

"Interesting character." Said Hemi.

"Solo operators... nobody who is happy spending days or weeks at sea alone --- eating cold canned food no less --- ever totally has their head screwed on fucking right. Anyway, it doesn't fucking matter how pleasant a person he is. The question is, is there _anything_ you can do with that boat that's going to help us?"

"I'm not entirely hopeful. It's not much of a craft, and is not likely to have much in the way of resources aboard. "

"Find us something Hemi. And don't do anything to set off that tweaked motherfucker while you're over there though."

"I shall be a lamb among the lions."

From the sail of the _Gnat_ Shakes' head and arm popped up and gestured. "Come on over man-mountain. Mind the gap!"

Hemi was just as nimble at hopping the gap as Shakes has been, but it was a more interesting move to watch because of his great size. Hemi was wearing regular boots and the water washing the deck of the _Gnat_ was wetting the lower part of his legs. He stepped up and over in the open hatch in the sail, and from where Percy was watching, it seemed for a moment like there was no way that huge man was getting into that tiny hatch. But Hemi disappeared into the boat just as quickly as Shakes did.

Percy gave Bastian a pull on the sleeve, and he tossed a smoked-out butt into the ocean before they climbed up the sail to head back inside the _Prospect_.


### On board the _Gnat_

"So what do you think?" Asked Shakes. "Ain't it the finest boat ye ever had the pleasure of pushing inside of?" Shakes seemed genuinely proud.

"It's certainly a masterpiece of the genre." Even more evenly than usual.

Hemi had spent nearly his entire life among and inside filthy machines, but he had never seen anything as grimey as this. There was literal garbage all over the floor: empty cans rolling back back and forth with the swell, candy wrappers, an ashtray that seemed like it hadn't been used for ash, but merely as a target to toss used butts at, most of which had missed and were on the deck. 

There were stacks of pornography --- Shakes had not bothered to hide any of it, or at least Hemi hoped that was true, because the stacks that were out were of such foul stuff that Hemi could not imagine what Shakes would have deigned feel needed to be hidden.

In one space recessed between the supports of the pressure hull were stacks of greasy cans still unopened. The labels had been peeled off and the contents written on them in grease pencil. Most appeared to be of some variety of highly-salted pasta-and-sauce. In another recess was a bin with what must have been a hundred different types of puzzle games with squares of color to sort --- all solved. 

The controls to the sub were aligned with and partially inside of the sail. The sail was the only place with enough headroom to stand upright. Or, at least Shakes could stand upright in the sail, Hemi still had to crouch a bit. There were small wooden crates crammed into the bow section, and more behind the controls in about the middle of the boat. Shakes had thrown what were clearly his sleeping blankets over the crates. There was still a thin heavily-stained mattress to one side, which Shakes was raising to lean against the pressure hull so they could get past the crates.

"Y'all woke me from a nap with the ship-to-ship call. That's why I didn't see ya earlier. I suppose you want to see the engines and batteries and whatnot? They're towards the back." Shakes pick up a brown bag from the deck that had some weight holding it upright, and extracted a piece of hard candy that he started sucking on.

"Yes, the engines first if you please." Hemi squeezed past the crates and pulled a small notebook and pencil from an inside pocket of his tweed jacket. The engine was massive and took up the entire rear third of the boat. Now Hemi was genuinely impressed. "That's a lot of engine for such a small boat."

"Took the fuckin' thing out of a tractor that had been broken down in a field for years on the coffee farm. Had to build a gantry and borrow another tractor to haul it up the mountain to where I was building the _Gnat_ and get it installed. Direct-drive to the prop, none of that electric-motor shit."

Hemi could see that, the grease-covered steel drive shaft came straight out the back end of the diesel along the center-line of the boat and out through the stern, like an egg on its side, pierced by a needle.

"But you said it's got batteries too, the boat can swim underwater?"

"Ya, the direct-shaft--drive means I've gotta have a transmission of course, and I worked with a mechanical genius on the coffee farm to build this fancy-ass transmission that I can switch over to that electric motor to drive.  It's a fucking grind though, I try to avoid it, except in emergencies. I have to come back here switch out the diesel and manually engage the electric motor with these levers. And the electric motor is small --- it's pretty slow, though silent as a submerged graveyard."

"It is the finest piece of mountain-top engineering I've ever seen on the sea." Said Hemi. 

Shakes grinned.

"And the batteries?"

"Batteries, fuel, ballast tanks are all below these floor panels. You have to pull them up to get at them. Since I rarely use the electric motor, the batteries almost always have a full charge on them, as they do right now, if that helps somehow. Obviously not enough to power your giant tub over there."

"No, not nearly. How much fuel do you have?"

"Maybe twelve hours worth left. Enough to get me to the depot."

Hemi scribbled some calculations. "How much standard horse power does that engine have exactly? No, actually, how much horse power does your electric motor have?"

"Fuck if I know. Hang on, I have a manual around here somewhere." Shakes pulled open a small steel door of a cabinet mounted on the wall and handed Hemi a manual covered with black finger prints and gray-stained pages. While Hemi flipped through it and jotted in his little notebook, Shakes took a comb from his pocket and dipped it in a bucket half-filled with oil dripping from the diesel engine and ran it through his hair, then teased it back up to a spiky randomness with the tips of his fingers. He wiped his fingers on his shirt.

Hemi looked at him through the small frames of his glasses, but didn't say anything.

"Alright, I need to go back to the _Prospect_ and sit down with my numbers. And I want to look at the charts with you so you can show me where this depot is. Can I borrow this manual? And do you have one for the diesel too?"

"Ya here." Said Shakes, handing Hemi an even fatter manual that was stained far more heavily, and had a couple of thick black lines along the ends of the pages of the sections most heavily used.

They climbed out of the _Gnat_ hopped back across to the _Prospect_, up and into the sail and down the navigation station.

"OK, where's this depot Shakes?"

Shakes pulled down the magnifier and scanned across the chart. "Wait, where are we now?" Hemi pointed to the obvious small x at the end of a string of grease pencil dashes. "Let's see.." Shakes tapped his wavering finger against the glass covering the chart, and rotated the magnified around in slow circles. "Ah, here!" Shakes said pointing to a small island marked on the map and labeled only "deserted."

"That's your major trade center?" Asked Hemi. "A deserted island?"

"Well, 'major' might be a bit descriptive." Said Shakes. "But look." He took the grease pencil and drew a lightweight but long line across the ocean. "The Territorial Authority boundary is about here. With total assholes on this side, and sort-of assholes on the other. So you can see how it makes sense to put a depot there to help facilitate trade in, out, and through assolevania here.

"That's true." Said Hemi, taking a pair of calipers and measuring the distance from their current position to the deserted island.  "I hope you're right about there being a depot there. There's no way we'll make it any further than that."

"It'll be there!" 

"By the smell of it, there's probably some food ready by now." Said Hemi. 

"Shit yeah. I'm starved!"


### A meal aboard the Prospect

Hemi and Shakes came into the galley of the _Prospect_ with Captain Percy and Bastian already there, crammed into the tight seating around the table. Gregory was working a giant cast iron pan at the stove, that was so heavy with frying rice that he struggled to shake it with one hand, a gesture he felt was necessary to keep the rice moving and frying evenly.

Gregory looked up when Hemi and Shakes came in. Hemi introduced Shakes.

"Fuck yeah," said Shakes eyeing the pile of frying rice. "I ain't eaten nothing but cold canned pasta for a week."

"None of your canned garbage food here, Shakes." Said Gregory, grinding the pan back and forth across the blazing red element of the electric range. "This is real submariner's food. Everything good that can't go bad. Rice, eggs, cabbage..."

"Are you putting that foul slimy-gray pickled cabbage in the rice Gregory?" Asked Bastian. "You'll kill a submariner if submariner's food is that real."

Gregory huffed. "My ol' pap worked a galley in a submarine in the wars. He used to say 'if you can heat it, you can eat it.' And this shit's gonna be plenty hot." Gregory dumped in an entire container of the questionable pickled cabbage, and stirred it around as the sound of frying drowned out any conversation. He only stirred it for a few minutes. "Shakes, for helping us out, you're up first." Gregory cracked an egg onto an already heating smaller frying pan next to the giant one full of rice. As it sizzled on the slick black surface, Gregory dumped huge piles into a big bowl and handed it to Gregory. The rice was browned by the black salty sauces Gregory had poured into it, and steaming bits of cabbage slithered through it. It was flecked with red and black pepper, and in a few places crusty black and somewhat burnt. Shakes was about to dig a fork in when Gregory slipped the fried egg on top with a spatula, it's white stained an oily, slightly gray color, and the glowing orange yolk a wiggling skin with hot liquid still inside.

Shakes grinned before plunging the tines of his fork into the yolk and letting it run into his rice. He then started working his way into his bowl with uninterrupted motion of his fork from the bowl to his mouth.

Gregory served up the rest of the crew the same way. Captain Percy asked him to run up to the control room and get on the PA and tell Chips and Owen to come up for some grub.

Hemi sat at the end of the table with Shakes electric motor manual open in front of him, eating his rice with one hand while scribbling down notes in the other.

Their hunger got the better of any conversation for a few minutes as they shoveled mounds of rice, egg, and cabbage into their mouths. Gregory returned and served himself, and then got up a few minutes later to fry two more eggs for Chips and Owen when they arrived, and few minutes later had to get up to make Shakes another egg. All told, every one of them had at least two servings and Chips and Shakes each ate three servings apiece. Gregory never got to sit for more than a minute, and when no more eggs were being demanded, he got up again to put coffee on.


### A plan

Chips and Owen took their coffees to go, and headed back down to try and keep reinforcing Chips' patch. When the rest of them finally all had a cup of coffee in front of them, and the empty bowls pushed into the middle of the table, Hemi put his pencil down. 

"Maybe some of you are familiar with the Angler fish?" Hemi asked. "In some species the female is enormous compared to the male, maybe like a hundred times bigger. The females are complex, highly evolved organisms, with sophisticated traps for catching and devouring other fish. The males are nothing but tiny sperm repositories. They swim around until they find a female, attach themselves to the female's underside, and then fuse with her body, essentially becoming a sperm organ for her."

"Hemi, let's try stepping around the metaphor and getting to the point." Said Captain Percy.

"Here's what I propose," continued Hemi, "The _Prospect_ has a hatch with a mating collar on the bottom side of the boat. Normally we use that for underwater docking in situations where we need to dock on someone's topside hatch. We could rig something so we could mate the _Gnat_ to the underside of the _Prospect_, and then feed up fuel and power into the _Prospect_ from the _Gnat_. Kinda like a male anglerfish..."

"Got it." Percy interrupted. "And you think there's enough juice left in the _Gnat_ to take us both to the depot like that?"

"We have to cut everything to the bone, but the math says we could make it. _Could_."

"And what the fuck do I get from your biology lesson?" Asked Shakes. "This plan is really me casting my lot in with you losers. Basically I'm donating all my fuel to you and hoping I can piggyback in, right?"

"We can pay you for the fuel Shakes." Said Percy.

"Plus we'll be fitting a nice mating collar onto the _Gnat_, you might find some use for that in the future." Said Hemi.

"And hot meals for til we get to the depot. I got a propane stove stowed somewhere, so we don't have to waste any more precious electricity on cooking."

Shakes, perhaps more driven by his stomach than he cared to admit, considered. "I want double the value of the fuel."

"Done." Said Percy.

"And you're buying a dinner of _good_ food at the depot."

"Absolutely." Said Percy.

"And... I want you to keep a line open to me on any future job possibilities."

"What.. like partners?" Bristled Percy.

"Fuck no. I work alone. But a man has to have a network in this game. I want you to be a big node on my network."

"Alright. Any job that seems suitable for a specialty cargo hauler like yourself, I will send your way."

Shakes grinned. Now they were working in a space he understood. The most profit came from future options. "So Hemi, what exactly are you going to do to my beautiful boat?"


### They talk Chips about fitting mating collar to the Gnat

Hemi led Shakes up to the control room, and Hemi got on the PA to ask Chips to join him there. She arrived a few minutes later, cursing. Her boots were dripping, showing how much water was still in the cargo bay.

"Motherfeckers, I am feckin' trying to keep this feckin boat from sinking. What the feck do you need me fer that's more impertent than tha'?"

"We need to weld a mating collar onto the sail of Shake's boat, the _Gnat_. It has to fit to the _Prospect's_ bottom mating collar. I want to attach the _Gnat_ to the underside, and run with it like that. Think you could rig something like that up?" Hemi asked.

"Weel feck. I might have some spare steel that could do that. Depends on what the hatch on that ther boat looks like, so I'll have to eyeball that. Possible it could be done. But tha's a feckin' tricky bit of sonar listenin' to mate like that. Can ye do that?"

"The _Gnat_ has a view port in the sail. He should be able to see where he is to do the docking maneuver." Said Hemi.

"A feckin' window on a submarine. Feckin crazy shit ya want to pull here. But look, I need to keep workin' on my patch, I may spend the rest of my lif' workin' on that feckin patch, really. Maybe Owen could do yer weldin' for ya? He's been getting the hang of it."

"The kid?" Asked Shakes.

"Well, she's right." Said Hemi. "The patch in the _Prospect_ needs work. If it fails, it could take both boats down. We'll give Owen a shot, and do a careful inspection of his work."

"If you say so." Said Shakes. "But if you lose my boat, I'll fuckin scuttle this goddamn tub of yers, and send it to the bottom after mine."

Hemi frowned. "Chips, go out with Shakes and Owen and take a look at the _Gnat_. Then get Owen going with a spare welding rig out there."

"Ay Hem." She got on the PA and asked Owen to meet her outside, and then followed Shakes up through the hatch in the sail.

Hemi climded down out of the control room and found Percy sitting at the sonar station with the headset on, listening. When she saw Hemi, she pulled one earpiece off. "That go OK?"

"Yeah, we're going to have Owen try the weld, Chips wants to keep working on the patch."

"That makes sense. What's next?"

"I just wanted to look at the chart and run my numbers again."

"That makes sense too. We should put someone on sonar, I don't want any Authority craft sneaking up on us."

"Put Gregory or Bastian on it." 

"Those dickweeds have fuckin' awful ears. We need another halfway competent sonar person."

"If we make it to this depot, hire someone."

"Yea. Alright, I'll get Bastian in here. Better than nobody."

"Send Gregory out to help Owen and Shakes. That's going to be a bit of a tricky operation."

"Good idea." Captain Percy headed to the galley to rouse the guys from their cold and empty coffee cups.


### Back on deck, with the cargo bay hatch open, lifting the welding rig and welding the Gnat mating collar

On the deck of the _Prospect_ Owen had the huge cargo hatch open. It was the only way to get a heavy welding rig out of the boat. He had assembled a tripod gantry over the open hole down into the cargo bay, from which was hanging a heavy block with a chain running through it. Gregory was down in the cargo hold hooking the end of the chain to a welding rig. When it was secure Gregory gave Owen the thumbs up.

"Hey Gregory," Owen called down to him, "while I'm hauling the welding rig up look around: we still need the material for the mating collar, the gangway so I can wheel this fucking thing across to the _Gnat_, heavy clamps, and a welding mask." Owen looked across at the deck of the _Gnat_ with the chop washing over it. "Uh, better get those rubber waders too." He lit a cigarette and started hauling the welding rig up, hand-over-hand. "This isn't going to be fucking easy." He said to himself through the cigarette handing from his lips.

When he got the welding rig suspended over the deck, he gave it a little kick, and when it swung back he let the chain out and grabbed the rig as it touched the deck and tilted back toward the hole. This was really a two-person job, a mistake would mean a 10 meter drop into the cargo bay. But what was he going to do? Chips and Shakes were over on the deck of the _Gnat_ drawing lines on the top of the sail with a grease pencil.

Owen wheeled the weldling rig out of the way and laid it down on the deck of the _Prospect_ so it wouldn't tilt off into the ocean. By the time he got back over the big open hatch, Gregory was back underneath with the gangway, and lashed to the railings of it the various other things Owen had asked for. Owen dropped the end of the chain down to him, and Gregory secured it to one end of the gangway. "Hold on, I'll come up and help you haul it up." And he disappeared.

With Gregory on deck they pulled the gangway up vertically to the deck, pulled it out onto the deck and got it lashed into place connecting the deck of the _Prospect_ to the wet deck of the _Gnat_.


### They plan the mating collar

Chips waved Owen over. "Thankyee for tha', be a lot'n easier gettin back to the _Prospec'_ now I 'spect." She grinned her rarely-seen wide-mouthed grin at Owen. "Alright, look. I'ma glad yer doing this shitting feckin' job'n not me. Going to be a feckin' nightm're if'n it works, and a feckin squirtin' trip to the head if it don't." She pointed to the top of the sail. "We feckin' lecked out though, Shakes 'ere made the sail fat enough that we can make the feckin' welds flat. We just need a piece of steel cylinder cut even, we'll weld it around the 'atch openin', and then weld t'e spare male feckin' docking clamps we got ont'e t'e sides of t'e cylinder."

"How're we going to activate the docking clamps? They're electro-magnetic."

"Yeah," said Shakes, "we'll need to drill some through-hull fittings. That sucks, but it shouldn't be too hard to make them water-tight to 30 meters, which is what I usually call the depth limit of the _Gnat_."

"Since we're going to be dragging the _Gnat_ along by the docking collar," said Owen, "I think we should also weld some supports on the outside of the collar, down the sail, and directly to the structural elements of the hull. It'll be ugly as fuck, but less likely for to leave the _Gnat_ ripped away from the collar." 

"Ugly-as-fuck is my other name." Said Shakes.

"Awright, sound good. I'll leave ya stupid feckers too it. I got me own weldin' to do." Said Chips and headed back up the gangway to the _Prospect_.

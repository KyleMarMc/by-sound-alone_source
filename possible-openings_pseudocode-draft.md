# possible openings pseudocode drafts



## possible opening pseudocode draft1

* {Open on a completely empty dome of black sky over a perfectly still pitch black ocean}

* {A submarine breaks the surface, it's sail rising up slowly. A hatch opens and a woman steps out on top of the sail.}

* {But suddenly there's a gunship on them, it fires and hits them. The sub crash dives.}

* {Inside the sub: it's going down fast. They receive a call over ship-to-ship and are informed that they are violating the territory of some complicated sounding authority.}

* {They go down, staring at dials (maybe steal some from earlier staring-at-dials-during-dives drafts)}

* {But when they go to level off, the boat's sluggish. (take from draft of captain not able to read what her ship is doing from the dials --- it doesn't make sense)}

* {the warning shot that hit them cracked a seal on their main cargo hatch. a crew member tells her that the cargo hold --- the enormous cargo hold --- is filling with water}

* {She orders the tanks blown. Warning sirens go off and two giant levers overhead are pulled. There's a rush of air and water... but the boat keeps sinking}

* {Panic.}

* {She goes down to engineering and finds the specially-fitted wrench and blows the fuel ballast tanks}

* {Not sure where it goes from here, they get stranded on the surface? Towed in by the authority ship?}

* {Connect what happens here to critical moments later in the story --- something wrong with the fuel tanks because of the emergency blow? the fuel gauge got fucked, and they end up with not nearly as much fuel as they thought or something?}

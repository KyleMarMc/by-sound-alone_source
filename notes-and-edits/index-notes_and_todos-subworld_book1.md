## story descriptions and title possibilities: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:descriptions:
* short lines:
	* "For them, the only way to know the difference between living and dying is the small movement of a needle on a gauge."
	* "Commerce always finds a way."
	* If Kelly's Heroes took the liberty of sticking a hippie into WWII, this book takes the liberty of sticking a bunch of punk rockers into mid-century machines. 
* more detailed description possibilities: 
	* Set in an alternate-timeline post-WWII Earth, where a combination of cold and hot wars have ground the entire surface of the planet down to a military-bureaucratic morass making free movement nearly impossible, commerce has found a way in the form of a network of semi-clandestine transport submarines that take advantage of the freedom of movement offered by the vast three-dimensional space offered by moving cargo underwater.
* just for a rough sense of scale, the average novel has:
	* 300 words per page
	* 3000 words per chapter
	* 90,000 words for a novel.
* [ ] Cover revision possibilities:
	* get a drawing done of the Gnat sail in modest seas with spindrift coming off the whitecaps. On the top of the sail is a pigeon.
	* Anyone who sees the cover should immediately see the pigeon and think: why is there a pigeon on a submarine on the cover of that book?
	* scale might be a little challenging
	* Or: A gradient of black from light at the sea surface to black in the deep.
	* In the bottom is the silhouette of a submarine -- maybe the prospect, or maybe the broken grackle (add ram?)
	* (unfortunately for accuracy the sub couldn't be more than three sub-lengths deep, but maybe the LOOK of a huge ocean of blackness is more important than accuracy)
	* A tiny silhouette of a pigeon flying above the ocean surface. (maybe the pigeon is much closer to the viewer so can be bigger relative to the tiny submarine)
	* (where are my other cover notes?)
* [ ] Possible book (though not series) title:
:titles:
	* Working title: By Sound Alone
	* Former working title: Under Dark
	* An Absolute and Blessed Silence
	* The Salted wound
		* (referring to the never-healing damage from the ramming at the beginning)
	* The Mouse's Wheel
	* Oceans of Oil
	* Echoes in the Deep / Echos From the Deep
	* Deep Blue Fever
		* (or something else that ties submarines and trucks together)
	* The turning screw
	* As the screw turns
	* A turn of the wheel
	* As the wheel turns
		* (wheel as in propeller)
	* propellerheads
	* Oceans of Oil
	* Sea Truckers; Undersea Truckers
	* Above the dark below / the dark below

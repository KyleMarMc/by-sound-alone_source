## Final production todos
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
* [X] add how to get on mailing list, how to donate. Somewhere. (maybe very last, inside the back fold)
	* Though remember you suggested donating to open-source software at the head of the license file.
* [ ] add a graf at the end about how the reader should pass on the book (especially if they made it to that paragraph). See notes about this in promotion.
* [ ] Add back cover blurb for print book
* [ ] make sure epub passes epubcheck validation


## story descriptions and title possibilities: 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
:descriptions:
* short lines:
	* "For them, the only way to know the difference between living and dying is the small movement of a needle on a gauge."
	* "Commerce always finds a way."
	* If Kelly's Heroes took the liberty of sticking a hippie into WWII, this book takes the liberty of sticking a bunch of punk rockers into mid-century machines. 
* more detailed description possibilities: 
	* Set in an alternate-timeline post-WWII Earth, where a combination of cold and hot wars have ground the entire surface of the planet down to a military-bureaucratic morass making free movement nearly impossible, commerce has found a way in the form of a network of semi-clandestine transport submarines that take advantage of the freedom of movement offered by the vast three-dimensional space offered by moving cargo underwater.
* just for a rough sense of scale, the average novel has:
	* 300 words per page
	* 3000 words per chapter
	* 90,000 words for a novel.
* [ ] Cover revision possibilities:
	* get a drawing done of the Gnat sail in modest seas with spindrift coming off the whitecaps. On the top of the sail is a pigeon.
	* Anyone who sees the cover should immediately see the pigeon and think: why is there a pigeon on a submarine on the cover of that book?
	* scale might be a little challenging
	* Or: A gradient of black from light at the sea surface to black in the deep.
		* This could be the 'director's cut' cover, and try to get the herschel-on-the-gnat cover for the final beta version
		* In the bottom is the silhouette of a submarine -- maybe the prospect, or maybe the broken grackle (add ram?)
		* (unfortunately for accuracy the sub couldn't be more than three sub-lengths deep, but maybe the LOOK of a huge ocean of blackness is more important than accuracy)
		* A tiny silhouette of a pigeon flying above the ocean surface. (maybe the pigeon is much closer to the viewer so can be bigger relative to the tiny submarine)
	* other possibilities:
		* [X] do a 5.5 x 8.25 page layout for pre-release print-on-demand draft
		* [O] At least for the beta near-final but-never-really-finalized version:
			* [-] use the same image, but make the water grey-green blue (maybe eyedropped actual ocean water photo - marine park bridge)
			* [-] maybe put the broken sub on the front on the spine?
			* [X] re-do the title: Under Dark (etc)
			* [X] remove "by" from by Mark Torrey
		* [ ] have Dave do illustration
		* [ ] It would be better, I think, to include illustrations of some of the characters ON the sub, rather than just the sub
			* (just a sub will only appeal to sub people.)
		* [ ] Maybe even anime-ish? To pull in the anime folks who might enjoy this story?
		* [ ] It's important that the cover, the title, and the description really capture what the story is and _feels_ like.
			* The worst thing you can do to an audience is mislead them about what a book might be;
			* And the audience will punish anyone they feel mislead by
		* [X] If you do a preview edition, or even a first edition, you could make your own cover from the WWII Tang drawings
		* [ ] If you come up with a symbol for the Prospect, make sure it is shown on an illustrated cover
		* [ ] could be an image of the Gnat's sail with just Herschel standing at his hatch --- this would certainly peak my interest!
* [X] Draw diagrams of the Prospect and Gnat. Include with story.
	* (Possibly by scanning and modifying from US Subs book Tang drawings in Inkscape) 
	* (No copyright problems, those are federal gov't drawings)
	* (People like me eat that ship up --- it lets you visualize where in the boat the people are at any time.)
* [X] Possible book (though not series) title:
:titles:
	* [X] title: By Sound Alone
	* Former working title: Under Dark
	* An Absolute and Blessed Silence
	* The Salted wound
		* (referring to the never-healing damage from the ramming at the beginning)
	* The Mouse's Wheel
	* Oceans of Oil
	* Echoes in the Deep / Echos From the Deep
	* Deep Blue Fever
		* (or something else that ties submarines and trucks together)
	* The turning screw
	* As the screw turns
	* A turn of the wheel
	* As the wheel turns
		* (wheel as in propeller)
	* propellerheads
	* Oceans of Oil
	* Sea Truckers; Undersea Truckers
	* Above the dark below / the dark below
	* It's a long way down
		* reference to the junior brown song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmNc0lmZkto 
		* "Long Way Down" is a published novel and newbury winner
		* "It's a long way down" is an amazon unlimited novel about an entirely unrelated subject

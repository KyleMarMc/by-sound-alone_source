Hi Mark,

I hope this finds you very well!

I'm attaching here the copy edited manuscript of BY SOUND ALONE. Though it's not a genre I usually read, I found myself becoming absorbed and impressed by the world you fashion in this novel. As curious as I am about it, I admire your restraint with regard to world-building - we only catch little glimpses of the order of things, only as they pertain to our characters, devoted as they are to their particular way of life.

In general, I tried to avoid rewriting and kept myself to matters of grammar and, where necessary, clarity. In terms of broader editorial comments, well, maybe there are a few too many F-bombs. At first it mostly struck me that most characters (minus Hemi) just seemed to speak quite similarly, though of course this does make some sense, given their close quarters and unique culture. I was pleased when Shakes, Miss Mai, and Cassandra came into the story, as Gregory and Bastian aren't very distinct, and Chips and Percy speak alike, if on a sliding scale.

Percy comes across as very brusque, even cruel, and it's hard to read her tone. Later on I gathered that this was an intentional part of her characterization, but she definitely toes that antihero/villain line in an interesting way, leaving Hemi as the heart of the story and Cassandra, with her lovely sequences of learning the sound of the ocean, as perhaps the soul. (Her exploration of sonar was one of my favorite aspects of the novel!) Because the novel mostly does not explore the interiority of these characters, it's hard to tell at first how we're meant to interpret Percy - as an asshole with a heart of gold (after all, she's the captain! She must be the hero!) or simply as an asshole? A little more access to her would be fascinating. I did feel fondest of and closest to Cassandra and Hemi, who may be the characters closest to the wonder of life.

I do think the novel is a bit too long, and that you could trim some fat by paring back the description. At times, the stage-setting feels a little too literal, your blocking too extensive - it's almost cinematic in that every movement is clearly described for the visual, but on the page, I just don't think it's necessary. See the descriptions of Shakes eating on page 45, where each movement of his fork is delineated, or the moment I highlighted on page 57, or the eating scene on page 84. Or take this brief passage:

    When the depth gauge showed the sail was under, Percy raised up the scope. As it came level with her eyes, she leaned into the viewfinder and started slowly scanning a full circle around the Prospect. 


I would edit this to:

    When the depth gauge showed the sail was under, Percy leaned into the scope viewfinder and started slowly scanning a full circle around the Prospect.


The language and the characters' movement can be streamlined, easing the flow of the story and speeding things along.

As a random note: the use of "Captain Percy" instead of "Percy" seemed arbitrary at times. I think she should really just be called Percy after she's first introduced.

Please let me know if you have any questions about what I've raised here or in the manuscript, or anything else I haven't brought up.

All the best,
Julia

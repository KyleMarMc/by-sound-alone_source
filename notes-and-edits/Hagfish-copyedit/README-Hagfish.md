This directory contains the Fall 2023 edits from Hagfish, originally in .docx
format (see commit 0f43a30).

I converted that to .odt and I'm saving track changes reviews (accepts
and rejects) in that file as I go making edits to the manuscript (still
in the original .md format).

In Libreoffice, I created a shortcut for Accept and next:
Tools -> Customize -> Ctrl-N -> Category: Edit -> Function: Accept and Move to Next
(This sets Ctrl-N to do this.)

Note: I also experimented with doing this review in Google Docs, but
the keyboard shortcuts were barely functional, and it took minutes for
Google docs to load the book-length file.

Hi Mark,

I hope this finds you very well!

I'm attaching here the copy edited manuscript of BY SOUND ALONE. Though it's not a genre I usually read, I found myself becoming absorbed and impressed by the world you fashion in this novel. As curious as I am about it, I admire your restraint with regard to world-building - we only catch little glimpses of the order of things, only as they pertain to our characters, devoted as they are to their particular way of life.

In general, I tried to avoid rewriting and kept myself to matters of grammar and, where necessary, clarity. In terms of broader editorial comments, well, maybe there are a few too many F-bombs. At first it mostly struck me that most characters (minus Hemi) just seemed to speak quite similarly, though of course this does make some sense, given their close quarters and unique culture. I was pleased when Shakes, Miss Mai, and Cassandra came into the story, as Gregory and Bastian aren't very distinct, and Chips and Percy speak alike, if on a sliding scale.

Percy comes across as very brusque, even cruel, and it's hard to read her tone. Later on I gathered that this was an intentional part of her characterization, but she definitely toes that antihero/villain line in an interesting way, leaving Hemi as the heart of the story and Cassandra, with her lovely sequences of learning the sound of the ocean, as perhaps the soul. (Her exploration of sonar was one of my favorite aspects of the novel!) Because the novel mostly does not explore the interiority of these characters, it's hard to tell at first how we're meant to interpret Percy - as an asshole with a heart of gold (after all, she's the captain! She must be the hero!) or simply as an asshole? A little more access to her would be fascinating. I did feel fondest of and closest to Cassandra and Hemi, who may be the characters closest to the wonder of life.

I do think the novel is a bit too long, and that you could trim some fat by paring back the description. At times, the stage-setting feels a little too literal, your blocking too extensive - it's almost cinematic in that every movement is clearly described for the visual, but on the page, I just don't think it's necessary. See the descriptions of Shakes eating on page 45, where each movement of his fork is delineated, or the moment I highlighted on page 57, or the eating scene on page 84. Or take this brief passage:

    When the depth gauge showed the sail was under, Percy raised up the scope. As it came level with her eyes, she leaned into the viewfinder and started slowly scanning a full circle around the Prospect. 


I would edit this to:

    When the depth gauge showed the sail was under, Percy leaned into the scope viewfinder and started slowly scanning a full circle around the Prospect.


The language and the characters' movement can be streamlined, easing the flow of the story and speeding things along.

As a random note: the use of "Captain Percy" instead of "Percy" seemed arbitrary at times. I think she should really just be called Percy after she's first introduced.

Please let me know if you have any questions about what I've raised here or in the manuscript, or anything else I haven't brought up.

All the best,
Julia

Thanks so much Julia!

I think that is the highest quality and most useful feedback I have received from a reader so far. (I guess unsurprisingly, considering you are a professional.) 

I find it satisfying that you apparently got what I was going for. I was somewhat concerned that -- understanding this book strays from your typical genre -- it might have just ended up being a slog for you to work on. Even if you are being paid, it sucks to work on a slog!

Honestly, I'm not sure it's really a genre I would read myself. But I'm not sure I can write the kind of book I would read, and instead ended up writing the kind of book I can write. Despite that, I do kinda love this book, and I do feel like if I could only figure out whose genre this book _is_, then maybe I can find some other readers who might love it too.

I'll spare you responding to all of your points individually. (On first glance, they all look very strong to me.) But a couple of things that maybe bear a comment or two:

    I appreciate that you did not want more details about the world. I really didn't want to write that book. But I have gotten that feedback from more than two readers: "Give more background on the world this is happening in." Honestly, it feels to me like the kind of feedback folks give when they don't know what else to say though, rather than something well-considered. And I wanted to keep it in the submarine, as it were.
    And maybe you'd be interested to know that I have questions about Percy's character myself. All I can say is that she's derived directly from (many) work relationships I've been in; where a strong leader -- even ones I admire -- are often total dicks to people in day-to-day operations. And I've also had the experience of people who work directly under those leaders being among the effective and understanding people I've encountered in my life. (Which, every time, makes me wonder why THOSE people aren't the leaders and the strong-headed ones relegated to some subordinate post where they can drive people without damaging them.) Certainly for fiction it's normal (and I think easier) to just write a hero, or someone who goes on a journey of growth, or even a clear antihero. But none of those people are people I know in real life. In real life, the people I've known in charge are often extremely competent and admirable for what they achieve while being exploitative and abusive to people who work for them -- and at the same time still want to be and struggle to be decent people. 


Anyway, none of that requires a response from you! Just FYI.

But do I need to credit you somehow? What's normal for this kind of work?

Thanks again!
--Mark

# Built out prose (draft 4) of subworld story 1
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------



### Opening scene --- night on a black dead calm sea

The weight of the atmosphere pressed the black air of nighttime down onto the surface of the ocean. The atmosphere had pinned the air under a murky dome of heavy cloud, and held it down like a schoolyard miscreant torturing some stick-armed runt. The weight compressed the air to complete stillness, and flattened the water, until it was unable to raise more than a barely perceptible heave under its glassy smoothness. 

A distant and feeble moon --- not visible and cast out by the atmosphere --- dimly lit the clouds to the color of the charred edges of a coal. The moon reclined, above and beyond, untormented by the pressure of the atmosphere but unable to muster enough warmth to intervene. It merely stood by helpless, feebly attempting to stir the ocean out from under it by the force of tide. It was all it could do to provide even the coldest dimmest light. The light that filtered down through layer upon layer of gray cloud til it was so diluted and refracted that it left the sky only a few shades of black lighter than the water. 

The ocean was unquestionably black. A blackness that came up from the deep. Beyond the atmosphere rode heavenly bodies that radiated light and heat, and the thick gasses of the atmosphere carried some portion of that warmth down to the surface. Below the water was darkness and cold, and the viscous liquid transported that darkness up to the surface, carried on vast swells of cold. As hard as the atmosphere might press down, the darkness yielded not at all to the pressure above.

On this surface, that stretched horizon to horizon, from the cupped edge of the dome in all directions without referent or feature, a point arose. A miniscule and meaningless point, like the first push of a needle through the underside of a new piece of fabric the workings of which would soon join the fabric irrevocably and forever to another with hundreds of gradually tightening, interwoven stitches. The point rose, a long thin wire sting extruded up, piercing through the surface. A thin V-shaped wake trailed behind it in the water marking its course. The wire bent back against the pressure of the air, as it grew up from the surface, it bent over more until it's tip was nearly horizontal to the surface of the water, held there in a long gracefully arcing line.

At its base the wire rested on a short steel mast which broke through the surface a moment later, accompanied by a series of a half dozen other masts, each leaving a more significant wake behind it. The low string of wakes carved up the black surface behind the path of the masts with their nested Vs. For a minute they moved alone on the surface, and the nest Vs grew longer and longer, stretching out behind them in a very subtle but ever-widening trail.

A flat oblong pushed through the surface and rose up into the air. Water streamed across the flat top and down the smooth metal sides of the oblong. It grew upwards, like a rising column of soot, and became a curved vertical wall. It thrust up against the pressure of the atmosphere with the same manner that seismic forces raised up a new continent. Water shot out of vents in the side of the walls, draining out interior spaces that had been filled when it was submerged. The curved wall sprouted from a giant body at its base, which now broke through the surface lifting the wall up into the air. An enormous flat deck washed into existence in a long line far before the curved wall of the oblong. The sea water pushed back and forth across the deck, the pressure of the atmosphere finally yielding to irresistible forces generated by this machine made by humans.  Water ran down the curved sides containing huge tanks that had been filled with gas moments before and now raised the deck up into the air. The surface of the black ocean gave before the unrelenting push of this leviathan, and a wake of dull gray broke on the smooth black surface behind it.

At first it moved with total silence, other than the sound of the water pushing and running along it's sides and the soft crash of the curling water it left behind it. Then it coughed, spat, and from two pipes that opened at the top of it's oblong dorsal fin two arcs of flame burst orange into the surrounding night, spraying apocalyptic color across the landscape of pitch. The flames flashed over the black glass of the water and reflected off the low clouds, and then died back into the pipes from which they came. They left behind the rolling churn of exploding diesel and hot air pouring up through the pipes and forcing the shutters open that normally protected them from the influx of water.

The engines of the machine revved up, and then maintained a loud high pitch, generating energy to drive it forward with controlled and contained combustion and trailing blowing heat. The surfaced ship reached and maintained an unvarying speed.

There was a recessed well set into the top of the dorsal fin. At the bottom of this shallow well, there was the creak of a rusty wheel turning, and a crescent moon of red light split the black bottom of the well and widened into a perfect circle as a hatch lifted open. The shadow of a figure climbed through it and up a short metal ladder to stand upright on the deck. The smaller first shadow was followed by another much larger shadow. Both figures looked around at the darkness, lit only by the red glow below their feet. They leaned forward and rested against the fairing. The smaller figure made a few extra gestures in the darkness, and a match light glowed against the end of a stubby cigarillo.

Captain Percy gestured with the glowing coal of the cigarillo out at the darkness. The figure next to her, dwarfing her in size, just nodded. There was no need to describe the all-consuming blackness aloud.

"Perfect night for a surface run." Said the giant figure.

"Perfect night for contemplating your own doom, Hemi." Said Captain Percy.

"It seems that in our business, we're always safest when our doom is closest by. Wear your doom like a blanket, Captain."

"It's probably best if you keep your imaginative comparisons to yourself Hemi. After all a blanket keeps you warm --- our doom is unlikely to be very warm."

"Perhaps so." Hemi paused breathing in the dense smell of Captain Percy's cigarillo; there was no reason to rush anything this night. "The usual plan for tonight then?"

"Same as every other fucking night Hemi. Charge up the batteries --- run on the surface til the light cracks the sky, and then we'll disappear back where we came from under the water. Make sure your keep those insolent pissants at the controls awake though."

Hemi put one huge hand on her shoulder and turned to climb down through the hatch. Captain Percy pulled on her cigarillo and the coal at the tip glowed in the darkness. Her doom would probably eventually be a doom of freezing, she knew that, but at least tonight it was warm enough to be up on the top of her ship. The blackness lay on it, and she did indeed find it comforting that in the blackness, nobody could see them. If she controlled all the levers of the universe, her boat would never be seen.


### They get rammed by a black sub

Captain Percy stayed on the bridge of the sail for hours, smoking her way through one cigarillo after another and watching the empty nothingness go by while her thoughts spiraled without direction out into the darkness. For a long time she was surrounded by an environment disturbingly deprived of sensory input. The diesel engines were loud enough, but unvarying. So too the vibration from the engines, which came up through the steel-grated deck and shook the rubber of her boot soles bu never changed in frequency or amplitude. The blackness around her was never-ending, though the boat pushed relentlessly forward. It occurred to Captain Percy that when her boat, the _Prospect_ was submerged, this is what it must be like outside --- lightless, unvarying, and often silent. It felt like she had loosed the bonds of her corporal body and had floated beyond it, so she could experience what her boat was like when it was pushing through the icy blackness of an alien world where the pressure would collapse a corporal body into a sickening unrecognizable mush of hemoglobin and fats.

As with many things that seem interminable, the slow but persistent forward motion eventually forced the dome of clouds to relent, and they pushed through to crawl out under a sky of stars and a weak, low moon. Captain Percy could see her hand holding her cigarillo now and the long shadow of the _Prospect_ stretching out before her, parting the waters to allow her to pass as she rode astride this beast of hers. This was a pure and rare pleasure on a submarine, where they spent so much of their time in a steel tube, staring at the same set of dials, with few opportunities to focus one's eyes on anything beyond a few feet in front of you.

Captain Percy knew her boat well. She had spent enough time with it to have internalized its movements. She almost always knew what the boat was doing just by the feeling of it --- the angle of the deck, the vibrations of the engines or motors. Even at depth --- when the hull and struts of the boat groaned under the weight of the water above --- to her the sounds of the boat under pressure felt like the normal sounds of a huge human taking a great weight on its shoulders. The only time she ever worried was when the _Prospect_ conveyed sounds, or motions, or input to her that she couldn't recognize. 

And at this moment, a collection of haptic feedback to her senses made her feel a rise of panic in her chest. The boat shuddered, as if the cold water it had swam through all these years had finally gotten a rise from it. 

Captain Percy was thrown violently against the fairing.

She immediately got down to the deck of the bridge, her fingers slipping through the steel grating and gripping on. She stuck her head over the hatch hole and looked down to Hemi's large face looking up at her from a couple of deck-heights below.

"I don't know!" He yelled up to her before she could ask. She could hear him giving orders to shut down the diesel engines and reverse the propellers.

The bow of the _Prospect_ had come to a dead stop, but the stern still had forward motion. Captain Percy could feel the whole boat turning unnaturally around its center axis, like a magnetized pin through a cork floating in a bowl of water pulled around by the invisible forces of planetary alignment --- the experiment of a child. 

The deck under her started to lean to the starboard side. Captain Percy braced one foot against the inside of the bridge well wall. The boat listed sickeningly. Captain Percy got to her feet, still braced against the angle of the boat. The pads of her fingers gripped the fairing, and she peered out over the edge into the night, scanning for a cause. The water remained black and calm, though not quite glassy as it had been earlier in the night. They were far from shore, in fairly well-charted though relatively little-trafficked waters. The _Prospect_ had clearly hit something, but in these waters there should have been nothing to hit.

For a few moments the boat hung at an angle, and then began to right itself, tilting slowly back towards port. As the fairing came lower, Captain Percy could see more of the sea off to port, and there now rose there the black curve of another submarine. Its bow came up out of the water first revealing that rarest thing on a modern submarine: a distinguishing feature. The bow of the sub had a modified and reinforced jagged point. A medieval looking device intended for ramming ships. Captain Percy had never seen anything like it, which was unsurprising to her because it must be both a noisy and inefficient thing for a sub to push through the water ahead of it.

The bow was followed by the long black smoothly swelling curve of a military submarine. It rose from the surface with water streaming slickly down its sides. The sail came up with dive planes mounted to it, sticking out like small wings and set at an angle to raise the boat quickly. When the stern finally came up to the surface, it was mere meters away, its swirling wake washing white up the against the side of the _Prospect_. 

"Might be our doom a lot sooner than we anticipated." Captain Percy said to herself as she climbed down through the hatch and the red crescent of light waned out of existence behind her.


### They crash dive

Captain Percy stood on the metal rungs of the ladder just under the hatch set in the ceiling of the cramped control room, and with one hand screwed shut the squeaking wheel of the hatch seal. With the hatch sealed, she dropped to the floor. Hemi looked down at her through his small-framed spectacles.

"Down." She gave the one-word order as she pushed the button on the wall that activated the dive alarm. 

"Give me full speed forward." Said Hemi as he put one large hand on each of the shoulders of the two men who sat at the controls of the sub and gave them orders to dive the boat. One of these men was a stick-figure of a man who went by moniker Bastian. The other, Gregory, had a meaty square forehead that echoed his meaty square body. Of the two of them, only Gregory looked like he belonged on a submarine.

Diving the sub required delicacy under the calmest circumstances. Now Hemi and the two men at the controls carefully timed their movements. Their eyes scanned continually over the wall of dials and gauges in front of them reflected in the red glow of the night lighting. Gregory and Bastian made adjustments according to Hemi's instructions, opening and closing various of the dozens of valves in front of them, or flipping on or off switches. The submarine let out a long exhale of breath: the air that had held it aloft in the water column being pressed out by an onrush of water from below into the flooding tanks.

"Flood the express dive tank." Ordered Hemi. Bastian reached up and opened a valve and water thrust through thick old pipes deep into the deepest parts of the bow of the boat. The bow pitched steeply downwards and Captain Percy reached to grab cracking leather loops that hung overhead. She angled her feet against the incline and watched the depth gauge. 

The ship-to-ship radio above Captain Percy's head lit up, and over the speaker a recorded voice broadcast a warning that they were violating the territorial waters of someone they had never heard of; authorized by a series of treaties with titles that became acronyms that became words that contributed to further acronyms. The recording ordered them to surface and prepare to be boarded. Hemi punched the mute button on the radio.

"Territories and treaties are for the surface." Said Hemi. Captain Percy nodded.

"What happened up there? Gregory asked, his eyes never leaving the wall of dials and gauges in front of him.

"We were rammed. Sub with a big ugly ram mounted on the front of it. Unlike anything I've ever seen." Said Percy.

"Obviously some specialty Authority enforcer boat." Said Hemi.

Percy was pissed. "This wouldn't have happened if we had someone listening to the sonar mics while we were running on the surface."

"We wouldn't have heard them coming over the diesels anyway." Replied Hemi.

"We would have known they were there soon enough to take some evasive action at least!"

"Later! We have to deal with being understaffed later. First let's get out from under this."

There was barely enough space in the control room for 4 people. They were all breathing each other's air. Hemi, in his tweed suit, took a rag from a hook and wiped condensation from the glass faces of the dials and gauges, and then wiped the nervous sweat from his hands with the rag. 

"100 meters." Said Gregory.

"OK. Level us off." Said Hemi. Gregory and Bastian spun closed some of the trim tank valves and rolled the dive planes level. The angle of the boat slowly eased upwards. Captain Percy pulled out another cigarillo and lit it. She nervously sucked at it, and then ashed it into a tin cup that smelled of her stale coffee from three hours earlier.

Being underwater meant they had to run on batteries --- the diesel engines they could use on the surface to generate power both for the batteries and the propellers. But they breathed far more air than humans, so couldn't be used underwater. The good thing about running on batteries with just the electric motors driving the propellers was that the boat was nearly completely silent. The bad thing was that there was a limited amount of time they could run before they had to get back up on the surface and charge the batteries with the diesels.

Hemi got them going slowly and silently at 100 meters down. The idea was to sneak very quietly away. For maybe 10 minutes, this plan seemed to be going well.


### They realize there's something wrong

"Something isn't right." Said Captain Percy. Just like when she was on the bridge before, she knew something was wrong with her boat. There was no single instrument that reported anything amiss. But then no single instrument on a submarine described the whole being of the boat. They had to be taken together, internalized, and combined with what you felt the boat doing. She would hold the depth in her head, while taking in the dive plane angle, and the speed, and the overall feeling of the boat. Normally this happened instinctively. She processed it all automatically, and she could just _know_ what her boat was doing from a quick glance at this wall of dials combined with what her senses told her and dead reckoning from the accelerations she had experienced.

This feeling of internalizing what her boat was doing --- something she did a thousand times a day, if not continually --- wasn't working right now. 

Her eyes scanned back and forth across the dials, but they didn't come together. She couldn't make sense of them and could not figure out what was happening to her boat. In this steel tube with no windows, for the first time ever, she was truly blind.

"Hemi... what's going on...?" She was turning red with frustration and she could almost fear her eyes watering. Fortunately in the dim red lighting, no one would see that.

"I don't know..." He reached past Gregory and turned the rudder. The boat came along, slowly. "Sluggish?"


### Captain Percy goes looking for what's wrong

"I need to go look her over. Let me know on the PA if something happens." Hemi nodded and Captain Percy slipped down the ladder to the deck below. She walked to the front of the navigation and sonar compartment and climbed down a steel ladder to the middle deck of the boat. This was crew quarters and their third deck-crew member, Owen, was snoring in his rack behind one of the moth-eaten old bed curtains since he was off watch. At the back end of crew quarters she lowered herself through a hatch and down another steel ladder to the lowest of the three main decks. If there were something physically wrong with her boat, this is the deck where it would be.

She flipped on the lights. There was no red night lighting rigged down here, it was just bare white bulbs behind cages to keep them from being broken stretching off in a line. In this part of the boat, the entire lower deck was full of batteries, strung together with rat's nest of black cables as thick as her finger. The cables were grouped together with wire ties and slung along the racks in heavy bundles. The batteries were bolted with rusting steel straps to row upon row of steel shelves. 

The floor was steel grating. She got to her knees, the steel grating pushing through her brown leather overalls whose age was betrayed by all the cracks the joints where her knees bent them. She put her fingers through the grating and lifted it up and put it aside. She reached her hand down and felt the raw steel of the pressure hull. It was cold, damp, and greasy, but that was normal. She replaced the grate and went on to the next compartment forward.

More batteries here, though fewer. They lined the walls, but not very deeply because there were trim tanks inside the pressure hull in this compartment. She checked below the grating again, but here too everything was normally greasy but relatively dry. She passed forward from that compartment into the main cargo hold.

The main cargo hold was one giant compartment, more than thirty meters long and almost ten meters wide. The air was still and stale and smelled of rust and petroleum products. The overhead bare bulbs had a harsh jaundiced yellow color. The hold was mostly empty --- they had been coming from their last drop-off and were heading towards the depots in the north in hopes of being hired for another shipment. A few molding wooden crates were stacked up along the sides, and a pile of rusted bicycles were stacked up in one corner and strapped down with leather straps to keep them from shifting. In another nook was stashed a couple of welding rigs chained to the wall and some bins of scrap metal. Captain Percy hated that they didn't have a better place to stow this stuff than the cargo hold.

She walked along the center line of the space, listening carefully. It seemed to her there was something wrong with the sound of her footsteps on the metal grating. As she got toward the front of the compartment, she realized it wasn't her footsteps, it was that she could hear water trickling. She knelt down and pulled up the grating. There was a pond of oily black water just under the grating. In it was swimming old cigarette butts and some long lost scraps of paper with notes written on them. The water had small ripple formed by resonance with the hum of the electrics motors, their vibrations passing up the hull and encoding themselves on this surface. 

The ramming had cracked the pressure hull, and the _Prospect's_ cargo hold was filling slowly with water.


### Hemi deals with the pursuing sub in the control room

"Keep this depth, and course, I'll be down in sonar listening for our friend." Hemi climbed down from the small control room to the compartment below. From the sonar station below he could almost see up into the control room, and could still tell the guys in the control room what he wanted them to do. Likewise, Gregory and Bastian could still give him reports on the _Prospect's_ status, albeit with a little more gusto to their voices. 

He didn't bother sitting down at the sonar station, instead standing behind the empty sonar operator's chair and slipped the old headphones onto his head, covering one ear and leaving the other free.  He spun the control wheel for the sonar around slowly, listening for human sounds out there in the darkness. It was dead silent.

"Hemi," Gregory called down through the hatch, "I'm having trouble keeping the boat level. I find I keep having to give it more and more dive plane angle just to keep from gaining depth."

"Let me come up and play with the trim tanks." Said Hemi, climbing back up to the control room. He stood at the trim tank controls next to Gregory and his thick brown fingers spun one small steel wheel, then the next. Each was accompanied by water pushing through pipes, flowing from one end of the boat to the other. "How's that?" Asked Hemi after a few minutes of adjustments.

"Better, but still quite a bit more dive plane angle that I would expect for keeping the boat level." Said Gregory.

Hemi didn't say out loud what he was thinking: they were sinking.


### Captain Percy goes to recruit Chips to help fix the leak

"Sweet hell." Percy said to herself. "Sweet hell!" She yelled. She ran up the cargo hold, and back into the battery compartments. She pulled the heavy watertight bulkhead closed behind her with a loud metal-on-metal sound. She turned the wheel to seal it. It took all her strength, these seal were rarely used and they were planting themselves ever more firmly into a rusted stasis as time passed.

She climbed up a deck, and passed out the back of crew quarters, through the galley and into the engine room. The only sound there was the quiet hum of the electric motors running in the next compartment back, and a clanking of tools from the deck below. She leaned over the open hatch to the lower engine room.

"Chips! Chips, come over here."

The clanking sound stopped and the face of the _Prospect's_ engineer peered up at her. Chips wore a grease-stained leather apron over leather overalls. She had her hair tied back in a thick black braid. Her hands were black with grease and were holding the body of a deconstructed piece of machinery the size of a baseball, as if she had been butchering some small game animal for dinner.

"What the Fuck's up?"

"There's a leak." These were words no submariner ever wanted to hear. But Chips had fixed leaks before. It was the answer to the next question that Captain Percy didn't want to have to give.

"I was wondering when someone would make their fucking way down here and tell me why the fuck the boat has been moving so funny. Where the fuck is it?"

"...In the cargo hold."

"And it's bad, eh?"

"Pretty... bad. Authority sub rammed us on the surface."

"So we're fuckin' fucked then, eh? Fuckin fucked, because the cargo hold's too big, and the boat won't fuckin float if's flooded, eh Capt' Percy? Fuckin' fucked!" She threw her piece of machinery at the wall where it's loosely-held assembly collapsed and sent small part flying into far gritty corners of the lower engine room.

"For fuck's sake Chips, yes we're fucked, but we're not _fuckin'_ fucked, yet... I need you to take one of the guys, go in there, and see if you can stop it and patch it so we don't get to the point where we _are_ fuckin' fucked. Right?"

"Ah, fuck ya Capt." Chips started climbing up the ladder.

"And damn it Chips, good or bad, I want regular reports. Get Owen up and get him helping you."

"eh fuckin' 'kay."

A loud ringing ping echoed through the steel hull of the boat. It hit them broadside, and passed through. It rang off the opposite side of the hull and echoed back through the air to their ears. 

"Ah, and someone's fuckin' hunting us too!" Cursed Chips.

"Go!" Said Captain Percy. She left Chips digging out hull patch kits from engineering storage and went back up to the control room.

Hemi looked at her. "I guess they have no reason to fear giving away their position to us with an active sonar ping, since we have nothing to shoot at them." 

"Someday, Hemi, I'll make the _Prospect_ the first merchant sub with a torpedo tube just for you. Til then, no matter how big we are we're really just a small prey animal and our defense is to run and hide."

"There's no hiding for us if they are active pinging us." Said Hemi. "If you're back in the control room for the moment, I'll go down to sonar to keep tabs on them. How's our boat, by the way?"

"We're sinking. I put Chips on it." 

"Well, if she can patch the boat with expletives and downright pissed-offedness, we're in good shape then."


### Percy looks at the situation in the conn

"What's the state of my ship boys?" Captain Percy asked Gregory and Bastian.

"Apparently we're fucking sinking." Answered Gregory. 

"Apparently..." She agreed. She scanned the dials. There was nothing immediate in their impending doom. It was written instead in subtle ways, spread across the dials, and when the readings of the dials were understood altogether. The dive plane angle was too steep for the amount of forward drive they were giving the boat. The trim tanks too light, the depth deeper than she wanted to be.

"Since they know where we are anyway, you might as well crank the bilge pumps up to maximum power. Better to make a bunch of noise than to sink."

Gregory flipped some switches and another frequency of vibration was added to the regular background hum from the motors propelling the boat.

"How's she handling generally?" Captain Percy asked.

"The boat just doesn't seem normal. It doesn't respond the way it normally does, or how I want it to." Said Bastian.

"Here, let me try the rudder." Captain Percy turned the rudder wheel hard over. The _Prospect_ came about slowly but surely, she leaned over slightly, as she should, but after a short delay the whole boat leaned more sharply. Percy counter-steered and brought her back to the course they had been on.

"See? That doesn't seem quite OK to me." Said Bastian.

Captain Percy knew it was more than not OK. The sharp list after the delay was the weight of the slack water in the bilge pouring over to one side of the boat and dragging the rest of the boat over with the weight of its movement.

### Percy goes to check on Chips' progress

"I... need to go check on Chips." Percy slid back down the ladder from the control room, saw Hemi was concentrating on listening to the headphones at the sonar station, and continued forward until she got to the stairs down into the cargo hold. 

Chips and Owen were at the far end, with bright work lamps rigged up. Owen was dragging a fat, grimy hose for an old mobile bilge pump from the pool of black water in the bow of the ship up the middle of the cargo hold intending to connect it up to one of the trim tanks. Chips had a whole set of the floor grates out and stacked up. She was wearing thick rubber waders and standing directly on the inside of the pressure hull in the slick, fetid water. The water had pooled up above the grating level and was almost to Chips' chest, though she was not a very tall woman. She had heavy rubber welding gloves on and a mask so she could see what she was doing under the water, and another dark-lensed mask above that for welding that could flipped up or down as required for doing the work. 

As Percy was walking down the cargo hold Chips' head was disappearing under the surface. Captain Percy stood on the grating above her watching. The welding rig next to her revved up with a groaning whine and a stream of bubbles and flashing blue light pierced through the turbid dark water. When Chips lifted her head up for air, water ran down her mask in rivulets, and drained in a greasy gray stream from her thick braid of hair. Percy asked her to report.

"Fuck ya, ya damn dominating twat. This is delicate work here, and it needs time. It's got hundreds of tiny cracks. The hull split open the way ya might break off a piece of cheese --- tiny cracks all the way along. If it were one big crack it would be much fucking simpler. Hand me that fuckin' patch piece by your feet."

Captain Percy spat, and her spit tasted oily and gritty, like the bilge water filling her boat. She handed Chips the flat piece of sheet steel, coated in a slippery residue. Chips held it against the side of the hull and pulled a hammer from a loop on her waders. She hammered it against the side of the hull with heavy, ringing smacks of her hammer, shaping it to the curve of the boat. Percy was sure she could hear the ring of the hammer traveling along the steel pressure hull all the way to the stern. She could imagine the sound going out into the water, but that hardly mattered since those who pursued them knew exactly where they were anyway. 

Chips took her now properly curved piece of patch steel and submerged again. Percy watched her work for a quarter of an hour or so. In that time the line of water on the hull have visibly risen, crawling its way up the grated floor, slowly consuming her boat. Owen came back and started up the rattly old bilge pump and with a whine and a rush of water inside its hose it began a losing battle to take back some of the boat from the maw of the beast consuming it.

It was hopeless though. The water level in the cargo hold was rising more slowly, but still relentlessly rising. By the next time Chips brought her head above water, Captain Percy had made a decision she didn't want to make. "Keep working." She told Chips.  "I'm going to blow the tanks and bring us up to the surface."

"Ah, fuckin' smartest thing ya said yet this day. This course we're pursuing right now is on trackway to the gates a' Hell."

Blowing the tanks was an emergency maneuver. It meant opening the valves that would allow air to flow through the rusty old pipes of the ship and push into the tops of the main ballast tanks. The air forced in the top of the tanks would push water out the bottom. When enough water was forced out, the huge bubbles of damp greasy air would rapidly raise the submarine up to the surface, like a child being gripped in the armpits and tossed up into the air. Fully blowing out the tanks was only ever done in emergencies and drills, and drills were few and far between on a transport sub like the _Prospect_. It put stresses on the old boat that she was designed to handle --- when she was built more than 20 years ago.


### Hemi blows the tanks

Percy climbed back up the stairs to the third deck moving towards the control room. As she passed Hemi at the sonar station she told him she wanted to blow the tanks. He nodded, as if he had expected that move. "What about the sub following us?" He asked.

"We've reached the point where we're better off with them up here than sinking down here." She replied. "I'll be in the control room to keep her stable during the rise. I want you to open the tank blow valves."

"On it." Said Hemi, taking off the headset as he stood.

Up in the control room Percy told Gregory and Bastian her intention to blow the tanks. "Right." Said Gregory nervously. Bastian nodded stoically. 

The emergency blow station was at the back of the sonar & navigation compartment, where the equipment made a subtle shift from the technical to the mechanical. It consisted of a number of pipes mounted up against the wall of the compartment. The pipes ran forward and aft from the blow station, off into the many deep, complicated parts of the ship that controlled buoyancy. The pipes had the diameters of large soup cans. They had been painted over many times, giving them a thick smoothed-over texture, except where the paint had chipped off with flecks of rust. They were stacked up, more than a dozen, some on passing through on their way up to the tank control panel in the control room, others routed through here for the convenience of the engineering of the boat. 

Four of the thickest pipes led from the high-pressure air tanks to the main ballast tanks and had large valves set in them that could be opened or closed  by turning a heavy nut. That required a large wrench.

Hemi stood in front of the pipes and opened a long thin toolbox bolted to the wall between them. From it he took a wrench as long as a forearm, not Hemi's forearm, but the forearm of an average-sized human. The wrench was wrapped in a heavily-pilled rag that had been dyed a bland gray color from the decades of grease worked permanently into the fibers. He fitted the end of the wrench over one of the heavy nuts controlling the valves.

"I'm ready to blow the tanks." He said up to the control room hatch above, giving his voice a good deal of emphasis. "Let me know when you're ready."

There was a pause while Captain Percy got the trim tanks and control surfaces of the boat configured the particular way she wanted them for this hazardous maneuver. Then: "OK Hemi, blow 'em!"

Hemi pushed the emergency blow alarm button set in an electrical box between the pipes, and a klaxon wailed into the deepest corners of the _Prospect_.  Then he turned the wrench until it was horizontal, aligning it with the run of the old pipe. He repeated this action with the sister pipe running just above it. Accompanying each turn was a squeal and a hiss, and then a rush of air moving through the pipe, like the howl of the hunting hounds of an ancient god, riding across the sky. 

The expanding air in the pipes forced their temperature to drop. Their surfaces
were instantaneously coated in condensate, which froze and sublimated to vapor,
rising up and away from the pipes like two long otherworldly fingers passing
through the compartment and gripping the ship.  To Hemi, the air in the pipes
felt like the shot of a canon moving past him, leaving a trail of smoke marking
its path. He had the sense of it pushing out through the ship in every
direction. The hissing, flushing sound of air pressing water out passed through
the ship, and the very mass of the ship itself shifted under the force of it.

"Take us up guys. Set the dive planes, and blow any trim tanks you haven't yet." Percy said to Gregory and Bastian. They turned the control wheels. But within seconds Percy again felt the wounded behavior of the boat. The stern was rising faster than the bow. The angle the deck under her feet was in the wrong direction. "What's wrong?!" She shouted at Gregory. Her eyes scanning rapidly across the instruments. "Trim!" She started spinning open valves on the tank control panel, trying desperately to level the boat. Gregory was twisting the dive plane control, trying to angle the bow upwards.  

A hazard light lit on the tank status panel. "Hemi!" Percy shouted down through the hatch. "The forward tanks didn't blow!"

"The valve is open Cap." He said, looking at the indicator on the nut to double-check his work. "The ramming must have pinched the high-pressure pipes to the forward ballast tanks."

The stern slowed its ascent. The _Prospect_ hung in the water, the bow pitched downwards. "We're no longer rising" said Bastian, looking at the depth gauge. His face gave away none of the terror he had started to feel.

Hemi stepped under the hatch up to the control room and looked up at Percy through his small glasses frames. His face only a few finger-widths from the hatch opening because he was so large. "Captain Percy," he said, "I think we need to start thinking about more drastic measures to get us back on the surface."


### Percy blows the fuel ballast

"The fuel ballast?" Percy asked Hemi.

"Yes, I think we should dump the diesel. Even if we get to the surface, we could lose the boat if the cargo hold keeps flooding and we can't figure out how to empty it. That's a bigger risk than not having enough fuel to get to a port if we do manage to keep the boat on the surface."

Captain Percy considered. But sometimes considerations are meaningless. They had passed the point of developing a strategy to evade their pursuers. For a submarine captain, the situation she now faced was the single biggest nightmare: get to the surface at any cost. Knowing that, the decision to blow out the fuel ballast tanks --- to dump all their diesel in the ocean --- was not even one that had to be made.

"OK Hemi. Come up here. Keep her under control. I'll blow the fuel ballast myself."

There were in fact two long thin toolboxes bolted to the wall at the emergency blow station. One had the main ballast tank blow wrench, which she had already used. The second toolbox was padlocked. It contained the fuel ballast blow wrench. Just like the main ballast, the fuel tanks could be blown out with high pressure air too. The difference was that blowing the fuel out of the boat might give them an emergency pocket of air to lift them to the surface, but it left them without fuel.

Captain Percy was the only person who carried the key to this second toolbox. She unlocked it and withdrew another wrapped wrench the same length as the tank blow wrench. But this one had a special 5-sided socket that would only fit the nut to open the air line into the fuel ballast tanks --- the fuel ballast could not be blown out with a normal wrench. 

She pushed the emergency blow alarm button again and with the klaxon whining fit the wrench onto one one of the special nuts controlling the valve in the air pipe. Percy was pretty sure these valves had never been turned before, not even in a drill. They had been painted over many times during the decades the _Prospect_ had been operating. She put all of her weight onto the end of the lever and let out a long groan, but couldn't budge it. She reached for a spare length of pipe kept in the main ballast wrench toolbox and slipped it over the handle of the wrench to get some more leverage.

It slowly turned under all her weight.

Another rush of high pressure air pushed its tendrils through the ship. Their precious diesel fuel --- the only way to escape the lost emptiness of the ocean and get back to port --- was pushed out into the deep waters of the ocean.

Percy could feel the _Prospect_ respond immediately. The deck angled under her feet leveled off, as the bow came up. She climbed up into the control room, which was extremely cramped with three people and a giant filling it.

"Now... now are we rising?" Percy asked after a few minutes. But she was looking at the same gauges as everyone else. She could read them as well as anyone else.

Gregory was tentative. "We're... holding steady." He couldn't keep the fear out of his voice. 

Hemi made some adjustments on the tank trim control panel, and managed to get the _Prospect_ nice and level in the water, but could not get the depth gauge to move. They were still more than 90 meters from the surface.

"The fuel ballast tanks just aren't big enough to overcome half our main ballast being flooded." Said Hemi pragmatically.

Percy scanned her eyes back and forth over the gauges, dials and the settings of the switches, looking for something, anything, that could move her boat upward. She pulled a rag from a hook on the wall and reached over Bastian to wipe at the dials. Her hand was shaking.

Another loud ping echoed through the hull.

"Oh right." Said Gregory. "Even if we escape from this pit down here, there's hunters up there."

"They would have heard our emergency blow. They can see we aren't surfacing, so they will believe we are sinking."

"We _are_ sinking, aren't we?" Said Bastian. "Small comfort that they know it."

Owen, the youngest of the crew, stuck his head up through the hatch while he stood on the ladder to the control room. "Captain, Chips wants me to tell you that all the movement of the boat has split the cracks wider. The flooding in the cargo hold is getting worse."

"Our pit is black and filled with poison spikes." Said Gregory.

Owen looked at Gregory with a specific question on his face, but asked a different one. "Can't we surface Captain?" Owen asked.

"Go back and help Chips. Do anything she asks of you. Get the cargo hold patched and the flooding stopped."

"Alrighty." And Owen's head disappeared back down below.


### Percy decides to head for the bottom

Captain Percy was running out of ideas. It was easy to make the decision to get to the surface at all costs while there still remained some levers to pull and options to engage. But now nothing remained that she could think of that would push them back towards the surface. She cleared her mind. The surface seemed so far away. The surface wasn't her natural environment anyway. Up there was war, borderlines, treaties, enforcers and Authorities. Up there was conflict, nations, and bureaucracy. Underwater was where she belonged, where they were free to go where they liked, when they liked, by virtue of the exponentially huge amount of room provided by being able to move along the Z axis. Still, she had no desire to die down here. And no matter how safe and free underwater felt, there was always that yawning gulf under them, a black, cold, bottomless chasm. Once you go _too_ far down, you go down forever. She enjoyed her freedom, but she didn't want to wallow in its icy depths.

She put the idea of the surface out of her mind. What if she looked downwards instead of upwards? What if they could find safety and respite in the deep?

"Hemi, how deep is the bottom where we are now?" She asked.

"1000 meters, give or take. Essentially bottomless."

"Hmm." She slipped down the ladder from the control room and stepped up to the navigation station next to the sonar operator's station.

The navigation station sat on top of a stack of flat files which held charts they wouldn't use any time soon. Behind the flat files, rolls of charts that were more commonly used were stacked between upright stakes. When they had the white lights on, the charts showed their age, yellowed and flaking at the edges.

Hemi had their current position marked with a grease pencil on a glass sheet laying over the chart showing their position. The black smudges trailed up away from the shore they had left days before. They were in the damned middle of the ocean. It was a wasteland, far from any continental shelf or island that they could make it to on battery power alone, while slowly sinking. She pulled down a magnifier that hung from the ceiling by a retractable string. She looked closely at the grease markings on the chart, and the depth markings around them. "Hemi... come here." He eased his bulk down the ladder from the control room. She pointed to a spot on the map. "Figure out how to get us here --- assuming I eek out every ounce of buoyancy from my boat and ever last watt from our batteries."

Hemi peered through the magnifier at the chart, then pulled his slide rule from his pocket. He made some adjustments, some marks with the grease pencil on the glass, he touched his fingertips with the point of the pencil while muttering some numbers out loud. "It's too close to call, mathematically. I don't know if we can do it."

"If we can't do it, it's a very long way to the bottom."

Keep me informed of our exact depth, speed, battery status, and most importantly the rate at which we are sinking. As I get a sense of our rate of, uh... decline, I'll better be able to tell you what our chances are."

"I don't want chances, I want you to figure out how to make those numbers add up to us not finding the bottom a mile under water." She climbed up to the control room.


### They make the run for the tablemount 

Captain Percy gave Bastian and Gregory a new heading, and Bastian brought the boat limping around to it by applying some rudder. 

"You guys have to do everything you can to keep us up," she told the two men at the controls, "like gliding an airplane with a stalled engine. And I want to creep out of here. If we go too fast our friends above will hear us and know we are still moving. If we move away slowly and silently enough they'll assume we disappeared down into the hole. So give us three knots forward speed Bastian."

He reached out a long skinny arm and adjusted the throttle controls until the speed needle hovered a few hashes above its zero pin, indicating 3 knots.

[//]: # (Add: Bastian giving a detailed description of what happens to a sinking submarine, "you ever read what happens to a sub that goes down?" reveling in Gregory's discomfort.)

"Now," Percy said to herself, "the most important question is: how fast are we sinking?"


### staring at dials: depth vs the tablemount

It was nothing but staring at the dials. The wall of dials and gauges in front of them with their spindly little black fingers, all inching slowly one way or another depending on what each particular gauge was tasked with monitoring. The individual parts the dials had to play all came together in a symphony that marked time towards their doom.

Nearly every gauge mattered to Captain Percy right now. Nearly every one represented  a variable in the equation that controlled whether they lived or died: speed, battery charge, battery drain rate, the status of the trim tanks, course, rudder, ship angle, dive plane angle... everything mattered. But as in every equation some variables weighed more than others. The two that mattered most to Captain Percy right now were the depth of ship gauge (which mattered in every submarine maneuver of course) and depth under keel (which told them how far the ocean bottom was under them and rarely factored into a submarine maneuver, at least in the deep ocean).

The depth of the boat was slowly, slowly creeping downwards. Percy stared at the black line of the needle on the dial, and willed it to stay still. She was pretty sure Gregory and Bastian were doing the same. But it never stopped its shaky wavering, and it persistently gained towards the deep end of the dial. It had already crept three quarters of the way around the dial --- on a dial that was graduated in such a way that the far end, where its tiny steel bounding needle poked up, was beyond the capabilities of what the ship could survive.

They had watched it travel that distance the way one might track a long journey on a map. It seemed they had traveled interminably far to get where they were, and they looked back at the three quarters of the dial they had passed the way one remembers days and days on the road in a long cross-country journey. In actual physical distance of course, their depth was no more of a distance than one might walk in a few minutes to buy a bottle of milk from the store.

But the gauge that mattered most to Captain Percy right now was that depth-under-keel gauge. The instrumentation that fed that gauge was only so sensitive. It could show the depth of the bottom far beyond what the submarine was capable of, but nowhere near the actual depths of the deep ocean. At the far end of that dial, it's bounding gauge was cutely labeled, in an ancient naval tradition: "Bottomless." 

And it really did not matter that somewhere down there might be an actual bottom. For this sub, for their pursuing sub, for any submarine that Captain Percy had ever heard about, the deep ocean was in all practical ways a never-ending hole. Anyone who went down there would never find a bottom, and could never come back up. They lived much of their submariner lives floating on delicate bubbles of gas over that black hole that never ceased in its efforts to suck them down. The needle of the depth-under-keel dial had been pegged at "Bottomless" for days now as they have been crossing deep ocean.

Hemi came up through the hatch into the control room with a clipboard and a pencil, and leaned over the glowing red dials, raising his little glasses with his fingers to bring them into sharper focus. He jotted readings off the dials down onto his clipboard. 

Captain Percy fished her hand around among the joists that supported the pressure hull wall, and found a rumpled pack of cigarillos. She shook one out and lit it. "Are we going to make it Hemi?"

"It is a razor's work Captain. Numbers slide past numbers, and a decimal points worth of difference change whether we live or die here. And if the numbers _do_ work out in our favor, there's no saying whether --- should your plan succeed initially --- it doesn't simply perpetrate the complete failure of the pressure hull and doom us all anyway."

"I'm entirely open to other ideas here." This elicited a dead silence in the control room. "Alright, we keep pushing those numbers then. In a matter of an few more hours, we'll know whether our fates take us down into the hole, or grant us a short stay longer in this little bubble of ours." She sucked slowly on her cigarillo.

A third gauge now entered as a heavy variable in Captain Percy's equation: the clock. The fact that the clock moved so steadily relative to all the rest of the glacially churning gauges did not provide any sense of relief. Hours ticked past, hardly registering their existence. She sucked down cigarillo after cigarillo, nervously stepping from foot to foot as she stood behind Gregory and Bastian, gripping the backs of their chairs hard enough to pale her knuckles. 

She stared intently at the clock, willing it to move slower. They desperately needed more time if they were going to make it. Her eyes wandered back and forth from it to the depth-under-keel gauge, where she stared at the needled and summoned all the metaphysical powers of the universe to move the needle up off the "Bottomless" pin. She thought she saw it writhe for a split instant, like the flash of a small bait fish seen catching the sun in a shallow pool of water. 

She stood and took a rag from a hook and reached over Gregory to wipe the condensing droplets of water off the glass of the gauge, then circled around the aging pitted chrome casing for good measure. She could feel the little spots of rust and degrading metal catching against the fibers of the rag. She tapped the glass with her finger.


### They land on the tablemount

And the needle moved.

It just wavered, hovered for a second above the pin, and then returned to resting wearily on the pin. But it had definitely moved. Her eyes went back to the clock, more minutes passed. To their speed: steady at three knots. To their battery charge: painfully low. To their depth: too deep for comfort.

But the depth-under-keel needle moved again, rising up and falling back, like a dying crone trying to raise herself for one last curse at her hated relations. And again. And then it was wavering unsteadily above the "Bottomless" pin. The gap between the needle and the pin was tenuous, but real. 

"Captain," said Bastian, his eyes on the depth-under-keel gauge, "the bottom is coming up!"

Captain Percy reached above her head for a strap. "Drive boys, Drive." The sea floor was moving, but still far, far below them, so far down that if the boat went down now the _Prospect_ would be crushed into nothing but a greasy stain on that bottom. But it was at least a measurable distance now instead of the unknowable nothingness of the hole.

Minutes later the depth-under-keep gauge started rising steadily, like it had intention. It gave the impression that they were moving quickly, though in fact their speed remained steady and crawling, while the slope of the bottom had drastically increased, and was rapidly rising under them, a sheer undersea mountain wall. The depth-under-keel needle rose shockingly fast, in a way that might give the impression they were about to smack into a mountainside, and from there they would slide helplessly back into the black pit. Instead, the needle shot up and back to 250 meters, and then stayed hovering at that level.

"OK Gregory, now the stupid part: give me a gentle dive plane down angle."

"You want to go _down_?"

"Down Gregory. Now. Take us to the sea floor."

The dive plane wheel slipped through Gregory's grimy rough hands, and the bow of the boat eased downwards. Captain Percy pressed the collision alarm button and a klaxon blared through the ship. She pulled the boat PA mic down from the array of radio mics hanging from the ceiling and pressed the talk button. "Chips: leave the leak and you and Owen get out of the cargo hold. Seal the bulkheads behind you. We're going to bottom the boat, and there's a reasonable chance it will split our wound wide open."

At the sound of the collision alarm Hemi came up through the hatch. His eyes passed over the gauges taking in their situation. "Gently Gregory." He almost whispered.

"Yes friggin' gently," followed up Percy, "as gentle as you've ever been, like you're laying down a fevered child. Bastian, disengage the motor. Lets use only what's left of our forward momentum, and let our leaking boat take us down the way she wants to."

Slowly, slowly, the depth gauge needle turned to the right as the boat sank. Slowly, slowly, the depth-under-keep gauge turned to the left as the bottom rose. The depth gauge showed 250 meters. The depth-under-keel gauge came to rest on its other limit pin, labeled '0'. And at that moment the whole _Prospect_ trembled as the bow touched the bottom. Captain Percy felt the slight angle under her feet relax as the stern came down slowly and rested on the bottom too.

"Jeeees-us." Said Bastian. "The bottom. At 250 meters! On a undersea mountain top, we landed like damned Noah."

"Technically a tablemount." Said Hemi. "A relatively flat surface worn down from an ancient volcano. And yes, if you like, very much an antediluvian feature of the sea floor."

"Deeper than she's rated for," added Percy, "but not by much. If the pressure hull holds, we have bought ourselves a little time. But it's just as damn likely that the cargo hold is now completely split open and we will die here. So don't get your hopes up."

"As a bonus, we'll blend in with the bottom on sonar. Our pursuing friends will not be able to see us even if they come searching this way with active sonar, and will likely assume we sank." Said Hemi.

"Which, we in fact did," said Percy "and I would not be the one to correct their thinking that we will never rise to the surface again."


### Repairs on the bottom

It was time for Captain Percy to survey the damage. She got on the ship PA and told Chips to meet her at the entrance to the cargo hold, before heading down there herself.

Percy found Chips waiting for her at the bulkhead entrance to the cargo hold in the forward battery room on the bottom deck of the boat. Chips had a large wrench with her and as soon as Percy arrived she banged with it on the bulkhead. "Well Capt, it sounds fuckin' holler to me. Still air on the other side of the fucking bulkhead at least."

Percy nodded and cranked open the rusting sealing wheel, which squeaked painfully in her ears. The lights were out in the cargo hold, so they were looking into blackness, but the air smelled damp and they could hear dripping echoing in the huge empty space. This instinctively disturbed both of them. 

Percy reached around and flipped on the lights. The white overheads glared down on her cargo hold. The steel grating led down a very gently slope and disappeared into an oily, black subterranean lake. A couple of empty wooden crates floated like lost viking craft on it, accompanied by a film of black frothing grease that floated in patches like bergs among the viking ships. Any sound they made echoed back and forth from hull to hull through the air, and out over the water. 

"That's a fuckin' nightmare." Said Chips.

"We probably did more damage to her when we pressed her bow into the sea floor ---  like levering apart the bones of a fowl. We don't have much time before this whole hold is flooded and we'll never get off the bottom. What do you need Chips?"

"Ah, just fuckin' send Owen back down. And now it fucking looks like I'll be breathing through a fuckin' hose while I'm doing the stitching back together."

"Alright Chips. I'll get Gregory and Bastian looking for some more portable bilge pumps. They can run some hose down and see if we can't get some of this water into the trim tanks and back out into the ocean where it belongs."

"Fuck yes."

### Percy goes back upstairs, rouses the boys, gets coffee

Percy moved through the boat back up towards the control room. She found Gregory and Bastian crawling into their bunks in crew quarters having been released from control duty by Hemi. Their eyes were slitted and bleary and they were not entirely successful in their attempts to climb into their racks.

"Come'on, you can't sleep yet. Get some coffee and then go find some portable bilge pumps. We need to get this boat pumped out, or you'll never wake up from your little beauty naps."

She left them groaning and headed to the galley, thinking coffee sounded like a good idea. There was a tin cup sitting upside down in the drying rack. It was one of those blue tin cups with the white flecks. The outside of it had been dipped in rubber for use on submarines. The cups always left an unpleasant metallic in Percy's mouth. The one in the dish rack was relatively clean, just the usual semi-permanent coffee stains. 

The coffee in the pot had been on the warmer for hours. Maybe days. She poured it into her cup and added a couple of scoops of sugar. The taste was foul, like what she always imagined "sweet crude" must taste like. Her tastebuds rebelled, but the rest of her body knew better, and she felt an immediate wash of relief from the fatigue starting to plague her.

There situation was dire. They were still terribly unlikely to survive this. If being flooded and bottomed had been the worst thing that happened today, she would have been upset. But somehow the relative safety they had now compared to where they had been an hour before --- when they were slowly sinking over a bottomless hole --- made her feel surprisingly relaxed. Relaxed enough to enjoy a cup of burnt coffee at least.


### Percy talks to Hemi about surviving their immediate futures

Percy found another relatively clean tin cup in the dish cabinet and filled it with coffee. She brought it to Hemi at the navigation station.

Hemi took the cup and held it to his lips blowing the burnt smell off the surface. His glasses steamed up. "Chips have the leak under control?"

"Eh. It's deep under water in the hold now. She's going to have to dive down there to weld it."

"Unpleasant."

"That's one word for it."

"Even if we get it sealed," said Hemi, "even if we can manage to pump out, even if we get to the surface, it doesn't look good. That chart says we're _nowhere_ right now, and of course we have no fuel or battery."

"Still'd rather be nowhere on the surface than sunk on the bottom of somewhere --- in this case that 'somewhere' being a rarely-charted and never-visited undersea mountain."

"I'm just trying to get ahead of the problem. We're in a situation where we need to overcome a whole series of challenges, each in their particular order. It would be an ignorant move to not think ahead."

"And you think I'm being ignorant? You keep doing the thinking-ahead Hemi. You let me know if I'm not considering something that impacts our future survivability. But otherwise I need to focus on surviving our situation right now. And that currently means getting some of this foul black water out of my boat. Right?"

Hemi nodded.

"OK. Back to the cargo hold I go then."


### repairing and pumping out the cargo hold

In the cargo hold, Bastian and Gregory were laying out heavy cloth-covered hoses down the center of the space and hooking them up to portable electric bilge pumps the size of small refrigerators.

Owen had his own electric pump, a smaller one, and was feeding an air hose to Chips who was in water over her head with a welding torch in one hand and wearing a diving mask that was connected to the air hose. The welding torch was connected by hoses to the welding rig in a rack with wheels chocked at the shore of the lake filling the cargo hold.

Chips dove down and there was a quiet moment before a hot blue light lit up the black lake from under the surface, wavered for a for moments, and then died away. This repeated a few times before Chips' head broke back through the surface. She ripped off the diving mask. "Owen! I need another fucking piece of steel plate, and --- fuck it -- another brace too."

"Alright Chips!" Called the kid from the shore. Owen was wearing the same greasy-slick rubber waders Chips had had on earlier. He selected some metal bits from a pile of scraps on the grating next to the welding rig and waded into the cloying bilge to hand them to Chips.

Every sound in the cargo hold traversed from one exposed steel inner side of the pressure hull to the other, so you heard every sound three times. That was normal, and Captain Percy was used to it. What really ate at her instinctual sense of a healthy, normal boat though was the way the mass of water filling one end of the cargo hold changed the sound of the space. It was hard to pin down precisely how it changed. It sounded like a room dominated by an athletic swimming pool. It was a quality of sound that should never be heard on a submarine.

She sipped her coffee and watched Chips dive again with her plates in one hand. More blue light from under the water. Percy had an idea to go and track down a meter stick and prop it in the water, so they could all see when the water started to lower. But then thought better of that, considering the strong possibility of the water quickly rising over the top of the stick.

Instead she helped Gregory and Bastian get the bilge hoses connected to the trim tanks and got them cranking. The hoses inflated with the pressure of the water running up the gentle grade from the pumps. She could hear it pouring into the empty trim tanks, and the sound of it echoing off the hull walls.


### Percy inspects the damage

The next time Chips was on shore trying to find a particular patch piece she wanted in the scrap pile, Percy took the mask and waded into the water to get a good look at the damage. The water was the freezing cold and never-varying temperature of deep ocean water. The water had picked up an unpleasant array of smells though, a mix of petro-chemicals and solvents, refuse, and old grease --- the stuff that always contaminated a boat's bilge --- but the odor  was lifted up by the sheer volume of water to Percy's face. 

The damage was bad. As Chips had said earlier: it wasn't one big split in the metal, it was a long string of short side-by-side cracks running in a line up a massive convex dent in the hull where it had been rammed. She put her hand out in front of her mask holding it over the cracks, and she could feel the onrush of the icy water pressing against her warm flesh. Chips' patches were pieces of curved steel that she was welding into place over the cracks. Chips was no expert at underwater welding, and the welds were globulous and imprecise. It was starting to look like a mess, but there was hardly any other options. 

She climbed back out of the water shivering and dripping oily droplets that clung together in fatty globs. Percy always thought of herself as pretty tough. But in many ways Chips, with her foul language and bad attitude, was a lot tougher. Chips had never even mentioned the temperature of the water.

With the extra bilge pumps running, she let Gregory and Bastian go stumble up to their racks to get some sleep. They slept through the next six hours or so of work while she, Owen, and Hemi did whatever they could to help Chips get the hull welded back together. Patching the boat was the only thing that mattered right now, and Chips was the only one who could do the welding. Percy, Hemi, and Owen found themselves standing around smoking and drinking coffee more than actually helping, so Percy eventually sent Hemi and Owen to their racks too.

Percy needed sleep more than anyone, but she knew there was no way she could sleep. Maybe, maybe once they got to the surface. She smoked up one cigarillo after cup of coffee after cigarillo. When Chips needed something she was there, but mostly Chips had her own method and didn't really want any help. When Chips disappeared below the surface it became totally silent in the cargo hold. Percy looked at her watch --- where time had been so relentless before, now it barely moved. Because of that it took her maybe more than an hour to realize that the water level had receded a bit, leaving an greasy black line on the pressure hull indicating its high-water mark.

Now Percy let herself have some small amount of hope. The water level going down was everything. The boat didn't need power, or the high-pressure air system, or a running motor to reach the surface --- all she needed was that water level to go down, physics would take care of everything else.

She waited for Chips to raise her head above the surface again. "Chips! The water level is dropping!" Percy shouted to her, while pointing at the black line of grit marked on the pressure hull.

"Ah fucking sure. I've patched so much is about fuckin' time."

"I have to go up to the control room --- there's really no way to know when we'll get buoyant again, and someone has to be there if we do."

"Aye!" Chips gruffed. She waved a hand at Percy and disappeared back under the surface.


### Percy back in the control room; staring at dials again

As Captain Percy passed through the crew quarters she shook the kid Owen awake again. "I have to go to the control room. Go down and watch Chips and make sure she doesn't die." It would be incredibly stupid to let someone, even someone as tough as Chips, do underwater welding without someone keeping an eye out.

Owen didn't say anything but resignedly rolled out of his rack to his feet, and rubbed his eyes before stumbling back down to the cargo hold.

Percy climbed up into the control room and sat at one of the maneuvering stations. The familiar dials and gauges spread out in front of her. The readings hadn't changed at all since she last left them, obviously. She took in the reading from each gauge separately, adding it to her holistic picture of the situation her boat was in. But the gauges weren't telling her anything new.

It suddenly occurred to her that the gauges were the wrong place to look for input. She would know the boat was rising before any of the gauges showed it. The water was being drained out so slowly that it wasn't like the boat would just pop off the bottom. She would feel the slight incline it had taken on settling into the bottom come off first. The boat righting itself would be the first indication it was rising, and she didn't need gauges for that.

She returned to her feet, fished her control-room cigarillo pack from its nook in the wall and lit up. With nothing that mattered to look at, she started pacing unconsciously back and forth. How long now? She looked at her watch, but realized as soon as she did that that particular gauge didn't really matter either.

She glanced over at the control gauges and just as she did, she saw the angle-of-the-boat gauge waver slightly back and forth in its little glass tube. Ah! She was wrong. The gauges might know first! But seconds later she did feel it. The deck under her feet changed inclination every so slightly, She reached up and grabbed a strap, and then the whole boat rolled a couple of degrees towards level, shaking off her lethargic repose. But coming up from a dead weight on the bottom of the sea was all she did. The boat hung there, relatively evenly trimmed, but the bulk of her weight still supported by the bottom.

"The damn trim tanks!" Percy remembered they had been pumping bilge water into them, but that water was still physically inside the _Prospect_. She noted there was reasonable pressure still in the high-pressure system and reached over to the ballast panel and opened the valve that would blow bilge water out the trim tanks.

There was the usual loud hiss, a beat was counted, and then the bow of the boat jumped off the bottom, followed quickly by the stern. The depth-under-keel gauge snapped up to two meters. She could hear suddenly-wakened crew members cursing loudly up at her from the crew quarters. She grabbed the boat PA mic "Fellow submariners! We have positive fuckin' bouancy!"


### A fight with Chips

The sensation of moving up instead of down felt oddly terrific. A relief in the change of environmental accelerations that only someone who has acutely attuned themselves to three-dimensional space would recognize. 

As soon as Percy had blown out the trim tanks, there was no stopping her. It was a slow rise, weighted as she was by the tons of extra weight in water still sloshing around in the cargo hold. Nothing like the violent rise that an emergency blow would illicit had the _Prospect_ been functioning normally. But they were steadily rising.

Hemi popped up in the control room and stood watching the gauges, smiling a quiet smile of intellectual satisfaction. 

"Hemi, don't just stand there like a cow." Percy said to him. "Sit at the controls and make sure nothing stupid happens." Hemi nodded and was moving into the planes chair while already turning the dive plane wheel for a more controlled angle of rise. Percy balanced the trim tanks at the tank control panel so they didn't go bow up.

A banging and cursing came up to them from the crew quarters, and a second later Chips climbed up into the control room, leaving a small puddle of black water at the base of the ladder, and a thin trail of the foul stuff behind her as she walked up to Percy. She was holding a length of steel bracing pipe in her hand.

"Ya gaping and pustulated fucking twat! You torrid and rotting fucking asshole!  Ya almost killed me! What fucking stupid idea came to your head to blow the trim tanks with no warning to me? I was fuckin' washed half-way down the fucking boat!"

"Damn it! Fuck off Chips. I gotta deal with surfacing my boat. We can talk about proper procedures in an emergency later."

"Ya fuck yourself and your fucking proper procedures. I'm talking about my fucking life you fucking swollen and carbuncled head of a syphilitic cock." Chips raised the pipe and pointed it at Percy.

Percy didn't even look at Chips, instead keeping her eyes on the depth gauge that was steadily showing them coming shallower. "Put the fucking pipe down Chips."

Chips snapped. She rushed at Percy taking the piece of pipe in a long swinging arc across the control room, just missing Hemi's head but connecting with Captain Percy's stomach. Percy doubled over immediately and fell to the grating on the floor.

Hemi was out of his seat a second later, and had Chips' forearms taut in his huge fists, like bracing on the cables of a bridge.

Percy wasn't down long. She got up to one knee before she fired Chips. "You're off the fucking boat." Percy said quietly between gasping breaths. "We get to a port, you take your shit with you when you get off the boat, and never again befoul my boat with your putrid, rotting person."

"Ya? Fuck you, you vegetatively stupid sow. I'll fucking be asleep in my rack while your fucking rusting shithole of a boat sinks around you. I don't fucking care anymore. I'd rather die than save your bulbous ass one more time."

Hemi was steering Chips towards the hatch down out of the control room. He had to let her arms go for her to get down the ladder, though he kept the piece of pipe he had been holding. Hemi and Percy could hear her smashing and cursing her way forward to the crew quarters.

"We all need rest Capt." Said Hemi.

"I need it more than anyone, but you don't see me swinging pipes at people."

Hemi nodded quietly. But he knew Chips was right on two counts: blowing the trim tanks without warning the boat was incredibly dangerous, and they would never get to a port without Chips' continuous help to patch the leaking hull.


### Surfaced

The _Prospect_ climbed slowly upwards. It tilted a little on one axis, then the other as Captain Percy adjusted the trim of the tanks, but more or less the boat rose straight up, since they didn't have the motors running and it was being lifted by pure buoyancy alone.

Percy and Hemi watched the depth gauge slowly roll itself backwards, up past their test depth, up into what Percy would normally consider safe operating depth, then periscope depth, and then the sail broke through the surface. Those in the crew quarters could feel the boat bob like a cork to the surface, and they let out a small cheer and ran to the bottom of the ladder up to the control room, obviously expecting to be allowed out on deck.

At first, Captain Percy wasn't even going to think about allowing that. Years of experience had ground into her the notion that you don't surface a sub and not look around before popping open hatches. There was always a chance that the only safe move was to dive right back down. But she fought back this instinct within herself --- there was nothing on the surface that could be more dangerous than attempting to dive her damaged boat again. She looked down at her crew --- minus Chips --- and waved them up through the control room.

Owen, with his scrawny youthful energy, led the way and charged up the ladder, struggled with the tightly closed and somewhat rusted hatch-seal wheel for a moment before squeaking it open, and then pushed the hatch up.

On a submarine, one never realizes how stale and still the air can be until a moment like this. Daylight poured down through the hatch into the control room below. With it came cool, moving air. It was air that smelled of the open sea instead of the stench of warm human bodies, oil, and diesel exhaust. The crew followed Owen out onto the bridge.

It was a cool, mildly breezy day. Gray clouds hung low overhead, and there was a mild chop on the water. It couldn't be more perfect, as far as they were concerned. Owen climbed over the fairing and down the rungs on the side of the sail to the main deck and ran up and down it shrieking like a small child. 

After a few minutes of just enjoying the surface air, Percy got back to the situation at hand. "Hemi, you were looking at the charts: who controls this part of the surface these days?" Percy asked.

"Umm, maybe the Western Federated Socialists? At least, they did the last time I looked at a Territorial Authorities map. But that was more than a year ago."

"Those assholes are bad news, and have no tolerance for surface transports --- even when they have papers." Put in Bastian. "We should not stay here."

"We would be on our way... if we had any fuel or power." Said Percy. "That lovely sound you hear of gentle waves smacking against our hull is the sound of a boat not moving. We're dead in the water, and We're still a bit fucked folks."

"Owen!" She called down to the deck. "Get back up here, we have to get back to work." As he ran over and started climbing back up the side of the sail she started laying out their next steps. "Hemi, get down to the navigation chart and see if there's any hope of any place we could limp to with what battery we have left."

"Bastian, get on the radio and see if you can raise anyone on the Independent Operators frequency. Maybe we'll get extraordinarily lucky and find some help from someone who won't ask to many questions."

"Or try to sink us." Bastian put in.

"Ya. If you do raise anyone don't actually talk to them. And don't _tell_ them anything. Just come get me and I'll try to gauge their reliability myself."

"Sure Capt." Said Bastian.

"Gregory... I'm starving, want to see if you can get something going in the galley?"

"Sounds good boss."

"And put a new pot of coffee on too. The shit in there now has been on that burner so long it looks like bunker fuel."

They climbed back down into the control room, but left the hatch open and for the next few hours a blessed breeze blew down through and reached occasional tendrils of sea air as far into the boat as the crew quarters.


### On the radio

Inside the sub, Captain Percy joined Hemi at the navigation table.

"The most pressing problem" said Hemi, not even waiting for her to ask, "is the batteries are almost gone. Even running extremely judiciously, we have a range of a few nautical miles at best." He used a compass to draw a dotted line around their position showing what was within range. It was a completely barren section of the chart. The middle of the ocean. It was nowhere.

"Not even close huh? Well, that just leaves help from someone."

"Most folks in these neglected waters are not much inclined to help those they don't know."

"We'll just have to hope we don't meet most folks then."

She took a couple of steps back to look up through the hatch into the control room and see how Bastian was doing with his work towards that goal. He had one stick-arm up in the air, adjusting some dials on the radio mounted in the ceiling of the control room. His other hand held the mic that was attached by a curling black wire to the radio. He was giving out mayday requests on a couple of different frequencies known to be monitored by other independent shipping operators like themselves --- both legitimate transporters and smugglers. Those frequencies were also monitored by Authority vessels that might be engaged in policing shipping and transport traffic. 

"Anything Bastian?"

"Nothing. Nothing good or bad. This is one voided piece of ocean you raised us in."

"Alright. I'll check sonar. Maybe someone's listening who just isn't interested in responding."

She over to the sonar station lifted the headphones over her ears. She didn't bother sitting, but stood turning the directional control wheel with one hand, slowly back and forth, scanning for the sound of anything made by humans. One nice thing about being dead in the water was they weren't making any noise themselves. She could hear even the small waves against the hull of the _Prospect_. It was a rare pleasure to have such clean and uncompromised sound on sonar. But for all that silence, there wasn't anything to hear.

Except... way off their rear port side. A very soft throbbing. It was faint and threaded, like the last heartbeats of a leviathan.

She called Hemi over. "Listen to this, and tell me what it is."

Hemi had exceptional ears for sonar. He stood next to her and put the headphones on and closed his eyes. The tips of his thick brown fingers rested on the top of the directional control wheel and eased it back and forth across the contact's heading.

"Small surface craft, and moving... unusual though. It seems like it has almost no hull sound. I don't really hear any wake running along it."

"Can you calculate a range?"

"Ya, it's close. Let's see." He looked at the dials of the sonar unit and scribbled some numbers on a scrap paper. "2 nautical miles, thereabouts maybe? I think you should be able to see them with the scope."

Percy nodded and climbed up into the control compartment. She raised the periscope up and spun it around to the bearing of the target. She scanned slowly back and forth along the horizon line, where the dark gray of the water press-fit up against the light gray of the sky. With the _Prospect_ on the surface, and the scope up, she could see something like ten nautical miles on a clear day. This was as good as vision ever got on a submarine.

"Even if it were a fucking canoe... at two miles away I should be able to see it." There was nothing but unblemished gray fields in her scope. She double-checked the bearing with Hemi. 

She was pointed in the right direction, there was simply nothing there. 

She had a hunch though. She felt confident about the sonar target. She was sure something was there despite the fact that underwater sound can sometimes play tricks. The lack of any visual on the surface narrowed down the possibilities of what it could be.

"Hemi, I want to motor over closer to it."

"What ever it is, it's small. Even if we find something, and even if they are friendly, there might not be much the can do to help us."

"Taking fucking risks has got us this far, Hem'. Stay here on sonar and track it."

Captain Percy put Bastian back in the rudder/throttle control seat. She gave him a heading towards the sonar target and they put the electric motors in gear. Her eyes locked on the battery gauge, which waved slightly as the motors started turning, drawing amperage from the depleted battery banks. The needles on the battery gauges were already in the red. There was such a very little gap of air between them and the zero mark. They would only get one shot at this. 


### Ship-to-ship

They were creeping --- two nautical miles an hour. Going very slowly would help preserve the battery power longer. After a quarter hour or so, Hemi called up from sonar, "We got lucky Percy, I'm tracking something like an intercept course. At this rate there's no way we would ever have caught them, if they were heading away from us. They have pretty good speed on. But..." There was a gap, and Percy could hear him scratching a pencil on paper. "But, we need to go slightly faster, can you do four knots?"

Percy sighed. It didn't sound like much, but it was twice as much power consumption. "You heard the man Bastian, give her a little gas."

There was a burning cigarette between Bastian's bony fingers as they wrapped around the throttle and eased it slightly forward.

A few minutes later Hemi called up, "That's good. We'll be within a quarter mile of it in a matter of minutes."

"They must be able to see us. They haven't changed direction or speed?"

"Nope. They must not be looking, or they just don't care."

Captain Percy stayed on the periscope, scanning slowly back and forth across the bearing. Still nothing.

"Shit!" Called up Hemi. "They're gone. No more sound."

"Stop the boat Bastian." The electric motors were very quiet when running this slow, but she wanted Hemi to have total silence for listening. "What was the last range?"

"About 500 meters. They're super close. We could ping them?"

"Ah, that would fucking scare the shit out of them. They might think we were armed and about to fire on them. We're trying to make friends here. ...I'm going to try ship-to-ship radio, we're just close enough they might hear us, and that might be a little less threatening."

Percy reached over her head and flipped on the ship-to-ship radio. It wasn't really a radio, it was just acted like one. It used the sonar rig to push sound through the water to talk to other ships nearby. 500 meters was just about the limit of its range. Real radio transmissions were supposed to follow a set of protocols and rules, potentially enforced by agents of Authorities in their respective territories. Ship-to-ship had no rules other than an informal argot that had developed partially to obfuscate meaning for any other ship that might be listening, and partially just evolved from nautical cultural habit.

Captain Percy took down the mic from the radio and brought it to her lips. She pushed the transmit button, and the needles on the gauges on the radio jumped to show how much power she was transmitting with. She whistled a series of five tones into the mic, and let go of the transmit button. The power needles died back to zero, and there was silence for a minute or two. Then she repeated the transmission of the tones. Another minute passed.

Then a crackly male voice came over the radio. "I see you over there, you hulking ugly gray submarine. And I guess you know I'm here. Why are ya sittin' on the damned surface, and what ya want with me?"

Percy hesitated, and then transmitted back. "Well, first let me state flat out that we're nothing but a transport sub. And we're unarmed. Second, we've been severely damaged, and swam through an icy hell to get back to the surface. We're out of fuel and extremely low on power. Long and short is that we're in some desperate need of help, and you are the only contact we've seen in these waters."

Another moment passed. "Yea. Well. These waters are empty because the Authorities running this territory right now are a bunch of tight-sphinctered a-holes who seem more interested in shooting down transports than letting any commerce commence. It's a bad place to be not moving and on the surface."

"Not movin' is hardly typical for us. What are you sitting on there? We don't see any ship in the scope. Any assistance you can offer would be much appreciated."

"Ehh, I'm not one who is much for offering assistance, and for the next few minutes here I think I'm not going to show ya what I'm running here. But if yer telling the truth, your situation seems pretty dire."

"I know that's kinda a risk for you to take. Anything I can do to reassure you we aren't anything other than we say we are?"

"The territorial Authority motherfuckers around here generally just shoot first, check papers later. They're not much for mind games." 

There was a long pause of radio silence. Captain Percy began to worry that she had lost their only chance for help.

The ship-to-ship crackled back to life. "I think I can risk pulling alongside ya, and poppin' the hatch. Don't send nobody onto my boat without my say-so, or I'll dive straight out from under ya, got it?"

"Alrighty, we'll look for ya off the port side. Out."


### Shakes pulls alongside

"Hemi," Percy called down to sonar, "we've got ourselves something, though I'm not sure what. You and Bastian come up on deck with me."

Bastian unfolded his long skinny limbs from the control chair and climbed up the through the hatch and up the ladder to the bridge with Percy and Hemi following. The wind was blowing a little harder now and the chop had kicked up a bit. Bastian cupped his hands and lit another cigarette. Percy and Hemi shaded their eyes, scanning the water. It was a few minutes before they saw a small gray oblong object cutting through the choppy little waves. It was a tiny submarine sail, no more than a meter long and high, with a couple of thin whispy antennas trailing from the top in the wind. Unusual for a submarine sail, it had a small view port in the front of it through which the pilot could look. At the rear of the sail a thin stream of diesel smoke floated up and away behind it. The deck of the small sub was totally awash, running just at the surface of the water.

As it got closer they could see the big splotchy patches of rust all along the hull of the mini-sub, and a slight oil slick of a trail that it left behind in its very minimal wake. Bastian, Hemi, and Percy climbed over the fairing of the sail of the _Prospect_ and down to the deck. Standing here, Percy was discomforted to see the bow of her boat sitting much lower in the water than usual, still weighted down by the tons of excess ballast water.

A moment passed before a hatch opened at the top of the sail of the mini-sub and a head of a man with spiked yellow hair emerged. His arms were still inside the sail working controls and he was standing propped on something so he could see as he guided the boat alongside the _Prospect_. Bastian opened a wet-storage hatch on the deck and pulled out some large white rubber bumpers, each with a long line that he tied off on deck cleats and lowered down between the two subs.

"Toss a line!" The guy in the sail yelled as he let the engine run on idle and climbed up over the fairing. He was wearing rubber boots as he ran up along the washed deck of the small sub. They were pulled over black leather pants that were cracked and gray at the seams and joints. From the left side of his ancient brown leather belt hung a couple of sizes of adjustable wrenches, the finish on the them beat away, matte and rusting in places from years of banging against each other on his belt, like chimes. He wore a worn black denim vest from which the sleeves had been inexpertly removed, leaving stray threads of denim trailing behind him in the breeze.

Bastian, still with a cigarette between his lips, threw across a line. The man made it fast to a recessed cleat in the hull of the mini-sub, and then repeated the move at the stern. He nimbly leaped across to the hand-holds on the side of the _Prospect_ and climbed up the curving side to the deck.


### Intro Shakes

He looked around with a nervous twitch, and then motioned to Bastian for a cigarette, who cupped his hand and lit it off his own before handing it to the man.

The man took the cigarette in a hand that shook slightly when he reached out, and brought it to his lips and sucked long and hard at it. "Ah fuck thanks. I ran out a couple of days ago. I go by Shakes." He held up his hand in front of them and they could see it tremble slightly in the air. "Ya can see why."

"That's a hell of a craft ya got there Shakes." Said Hemi.

"Like it? I built it my fuckin self. Welded it together on the top of a mountain coffee farm from scraps. They had a bunch of land higher up where the coffee don't grow, and it seemed like a good place to build a boat. It was. Cept it wasn't a good place to launch a boat from. Getting it down to the water was more difficult than the buildin'."

"I could imagine." Said Hemi.

"I've heard of this kind of thing," said Percy, "run fast and just below the surface. Basically invisible to any kind of radar, and too quiet for most sonar. Good for... small shipments?"

"Ay, 'Specialty shipments' --- when stuff has to be got somewhere fast with no questions asked. Just not too much stuff. I also built in a few special modifications --- this here ship is the fastest and most versatile in its class!" Hemi looked doubtfully at the rusting bulbous hulk alongside. "Most of these kinds of homemade jobs just run at the surface; I added some batteries and some trim tanks, and this here boat, the _Gnat_ is the name, can _dive_. Run a bit under water, just enough to get away from any curious onlookers."

"How deep?" Asked Hemi.

"Maybe 30 meters on a good day. You don't have to go very deep to hide in something so small."

"How fast?" Hemi's curiosity was peaked now.

Shakes grinned. "Faster than this fuckin' tub." He said kicking the toe of his rubber boot against the hull of the _Prospect_. 

Percy frowned. "Welp, that's an impressive submersible hobby you got there, but have any of you got any ideas how this is going to help get my boat moving? You ain't carrying a load of diesel fuel are ya Mr. Shakes?"

"Can't say I am. And I can't say what I _am_ carrying, ceptin' that I can't see how any of it could help you. Still, if I can do anything to assist, I'm game. I'm pretty convinced y'all ain't some Authority ruse, and we smugglers gotta stick together, I say."

"We're not smugglers." Said Percy, her eye firmly locked on Shakes'. "We're independent logistics operators."

"Ain't we all!" Said Shakes. "Honestly, I ain't got much in the way of ideas for ya. I was thinking maybe you was the smart ones. From what I can see y'all are fuckin' fucked. Best I can say is I could run into my destination port and send some friendly bigger boat back out for ya. But that'll probably take a couple of days."


### they find out about the depot from Shakes

"In a couple of days we'll either be sunk or in an Authority holding cell. There's gotta be a better option. Hemi?"

"Well, nothing immediately comes to mind. But that's with limited information. If a new option has arisen, it will be aboard the _Gnat_. But to sort that out, I'll have to get in there and take a look at what resources you've got Shakes. I'm not sure how willing you are to let me do that."

Shakes didn't say anything, but pulled on his cigarette and watched the exhaled smoke quickly sucked out over the water by the breeze.

"Mind if we ask where yer headed Shakes?" Asked Percy

"Ay, I was about to fuckin say anyway: there's a mid-sea depot about 100 miles from here. It's just over the line in the waters of a different Authority. Somewhat more permissive folks; bit more friendly to commerce. That's why the Authority on this side of the line are such a bunch of aggressive motherfuckin' assholes though --- they don't want shit running through here to there. If you can get this tub of yers to the depot, you can definitely get fuel there, and probably some poorly executed and overpriced repairs as well."

"Sounds like a damn Eden." Said Percy. "Look, we aren't the type to ask for help, and I hate imposing on other folks business, just as I don't want 'em imposing on mine. But you can see we're more than a little desperate here. If you can allow Hemi --- and just Hemi --- aboard to take some specs of your boat, see if you're carrying anything he can use, we'll make it up to you at the depot. ...though honestly at the moment about all we can offer you is hot food."

Shakes eyes brightened at that. "Hrm. Well I ain't been eating nothing but cold chow straight from the can for days now. A hot meal is a strong offer yer puttin' on the fuckin' table there. Alright. This big guy, and this big guy alone. And he don't look at nothing I don't want him to look at, and he don't get answers to no questions I don't want to answer. No pushin', right?"

"No pushing." Said Hemi.

"Right. Hang back a minute, let me go look around in there first, make sure all my pornography is put away. When I give you the signal, come across."

Percy grinned as Shakes lowered himself down the side and leapt nimbly over the dangerous gap between the two boats. He disappeared into the sail hatch of the _Gnat_.

"Interesting character." Said Hemi.

"Solo operators... nobody who is comfortable spending days or weeks at sea alone --- eating cold canned food, no less --- ever totally has their head screwed on fucking right. Anyway, it doesn't matter how pleasant a person he is. The question is, is there _anything_ you can do with that boat that's going to help us?"

"I'm not entirely hopeful. It's not much of a craft, and is not likely to have much in the way of resources aboard. Frankly, I'm surprised he isn't lost and dead in the water himself."

"Find us something Hemi. And don't do anything to set off that tweaked motherfucker while you're over there though."

"I shall be a lamb among the lions."

From the sail of the _Gnat_ Shakes' head and arm popped up and gestured. "Come on over man-mountain. Mind the gap!"

Hemi was just as nimble at hopping the gap as Shakes has been, but it was a more interesting move to watch because of his great size. Hemi was wearing conventional leather boots and the water washing the deck of the _Gnat_ was wetting the lower part of his legs, soaking his wools pants. He stepped up and over in the open hatch in the sail, and from where Percy was watching, it seemed for a moment like there was no way his bulk would get into that tiny hatch. But Hemi disappeared into the boat just as quickly as Shakes did.

Percy gave Bastian a pull on the sleeve, and he tossed a smoked-out butt into the ocean before they climbed up the sail and back inside the _Prospect_.


### On board the _Gnat_

"So what do you think?" Asked Shakes. "Ain't it the finest boat ye ever had the pleasure of dropping inside of?" Shakes seemed genuinely proud.

"It's certainly a masterpiece of the genre." Even more evenly than usual.

Hemi had spent nearly his entire life among and inside filthy machines, but he had never seen anything where the grime lay down as thickly as this. There was literal garbage all over the floor: empty cans rolling back back and forth with the swell, candy wrappers, and an ashtray that seemed like it hadn't been used for ash but merely as a target to toss used butts at, most of which had missed and were on the deck. 

There were stacks of pornography --- Shakes had not bothered to hide any of it, or at least Hemi hoped that was true, because the stacks that were out were of a class so deviant that Hemi could not imagine what Shakes would have deigned feel needed to be hidden.

In one space recessed between the supports of the pressure hull were stacks of greasy cans still unopened. The labels had been peeled off and the contents written on them in grease pencil. Most appeared to be of some variety of highly-salted pasta-and-sauce. In another recess was a bin with what must have been a hundred different types of puzzle games that all had the basic premise that required squares of color that to be to sorted. Every single last puzzle was solved. 

The controls to the sub were aligned with and partially inside of the sail. The sail was the only place with enough headroom to stand upright. Or, at least Shakes could stand upright in the sail, Hemi still had to crouch a bit. Through an open hatch leading forward, Hemi could see small wooden crates crammed into the bow section, and more behind the controls in about the middle of the boat. Shakes had thrown what were clearly his sleeping blankets over the crates. There was still a thin heavily-stained mattress to one side, which Shakes was raising to lean against the pressure hull so they could get past the crates.

"Y'all woke me from a nap with the ship-to-ship call. That's why I didn't see ya earlier. I suppose you want to see the engines and batteries and whatnot? They're towards the back." Shakes reached into his denim vest and withdrew a leather pouch. He pinched some dried leaves from it and stuffed them into his cheek and began masticating them slowly.

"Yes, the engines first if you please." Hemi squeezed past the crates and pulled a small notebook and pencil from an inside pocket of his tweed jacket. The engine was massive and took up the entire rear third of the boat. Now Hemi was genuinely impressed. "That's a lot of engine for such a small boat."

"Took the fuckin' thing out of a tractor that had been rusting broken down in a field for years on the coffee farm. Had to build a gantry and borrow another tractor to haul it up the mountain to where I was building the _Gnat_ and get it installed. Direct-drive to the prop, none of that electric-motor shit."

The configuration was obvious to Hemi. The grease-covered steel drive shaft came straight out the back end of the diesel running along the center-line of the boat and out through the stern, like an egg on its side, pierced by a needle.

"But you said it's got batteries too, the boat can swim underwater?"

"Ya, the direct-shaft--drive means I've gotta have a transmission of course, and I worked with a mechanical genius on the coffee farm to build this fancy-ass transmission that I can switch over to that electric motor to drive.  It's a fucking grind though, I try to avoid it, 'cept in emergencies. I have to leave the controls and come back here to the engines, switch out the diesel and manually engage the electric motor with these levers. And the electric motor is small --- it's fuckin' slow; though silent as a submerged graveyard."

"It is the finest piece of mountain-top engineering I've ever seen on the sea." Said Hemi. 

Shakes grinned.

"And the batteries?"

"Batteries, fuel, ballast tanks are all below these floor panels. You have to pull them up to get at them. Since I rarely use the electric motor, the batteries almost always have a full charge on them, as they do right now, if that helps somehow. Obviously not enough to power your giant tub over there."

"No, not nearly. How much fuel do you have?"

"Maybe twelve hours worth left. Enough to get me to the depot."

Hemi scribbled some calculations. "How much standard horse power does that engine have exactly? No, actually, how much horse power does your electric motor have?"

"Fuck if I know. Hang on, I have a manual around here somewhere." Shakes pulled open a small steel door of a cabinet mounted on the wall and handed Hemi a manual covered with black finger prints and gray-stained pages. While Hemi flipped through it and jotted in his little notebook, Shakes took a comb from his pocket and dipped it in a bucket half-filled with oil dripping from the diesel engine and ran it through his hair, then teased it back up to a spiky randomness with the tips of his fingers. He wiped his fingers on his shirt.

Hemi looked at him through the small frames of his glasses. "Can I borrow this manual? And do you have one for the diesel too?"

"Ya here." Said Shakes, handing Hemi an even fatter manual that was stained far more heavily, and had a couple of thick black lines along the ends of the pages of the sections most heavily used.

"Alright, I need to and sit down with my numbers and do some figuring. I also want to look at the charts with you so you can show me where this depot is. I think its time to go back across to the _Prospect_.

After making the jump back to the bigger boat, Shakes and Hemi settled down over the _Prospect's_ navigation charts. "OK, where's this depot Shakes?"

Shakes pulled down the magnifier and scanned across the chart. "Wait, where are we now?" Hemi pointed to the obvious small x at the end of a string of grease pencil dashes. "Let's see.." Shakes tapped his wavering finger against the glass covering the chart, and rotated the magnified around in slow circles. "Ah, here!" Shakes said pointing to a small island marked on the map and labeled only "deserted."

"That's your major trade center?" Asked Hemi. "A deserted island?"

"Well, 'major' might be a bit fuckin' descriptive." Said Shakes. "But look." He took the grease pencil and drew a lightweight but long line across the ocean. "The Territorial Authority boundary is roughly about here. With total assholes on this side, and sort-of assholes on the other. So you can see how it makes sense to put a depot on that deserted island just across the line to help facilitate trade in, out, and through assolevania over here.

"That's true." Said Hemi, taking a pair of calipers and measuring the distance from their current position to the deserted island.  "I hope you're right about there being a depot there. There's no way we'll make it any further than that."

"It'll be there!" 

Hemi sniffed. "Smells like there's probably some food ready. Want to eat?" Said Hemi. 

"Shit yeah. I'm starved!"


### A meal aboard the Prospect

Hemi and Shakes came into the galley of the _Prospect_ with Captain Percy and Bastian already there, crammed into the tight seating around the table. Gregory was working a giant cast iron pan at the stove that was so heavy with frying rice that he struggled to shake it with one hand --- a gesture he felt was necessary to keep the rice moving and frying evenly.

Gregory looked up when Hemi and Shakes came in. Hemi introduced Shakes.

"Fuck yeah," said Shakes eyeing the pile of frying rice. "I ain't eaten nothing but cold canned pasta for a week."

"None of your canned garbage food here, Shakes." Said Gregory, grinding the pan back and forth across the range. "This is real submariner's food. Everything good that can't go bad. Rice, eggs, cabbage..."

"Are you putting that foul slimy-gray pickled cabbage in the rice Gregory?" Asked Bastian. "You'll be killing submariners if submariner's food is that real."

Gregory huffed. "My ol' pap worked a galley in a submarine in the wars. He used to say 'if you can heat it, you can eat it.' And this shit's gonna be plenty hot." Gregory dumped in an entire container of the questionable pickled cabbage, and stirred it around as the sound of frying drowned out any conversation. He only stirred it for a few minutes mote. 

"Shakes, for helping us out, you're up first." Gregory cracked an egg onto an already heating smaller frying pan next to the giant one full of rice. As it sizzled on the slick black surface, Gregory dumped huge piles of rice into a big bowl and handed it to Shakes. The rice was browned by the black salty sauces Gregory had poured into it, and steaming bits of cabbage slithered through it. It was flecked with red and black pepper, and in a few places crusty black and somewhat burnt. Shakes was about to dig a fork in when Gregory slipped the fried egg on top with a spatula. Its white was stained an oily, slightly gray color, and the glowing orange yolk a wiggling skin with hot liquid about to burst from the inside.

Shakes grinned before plunging the tines of his fork into the yolk and letting it run into his rice. He then started working his way into his bowl with an uninterrupted shoveling motion of his fork from the bowl to his mouth.

Gregory served up the rest of the crew the same way. Captain Percy asked him to run up to the control room and get on the PA and tell Owen to come up for some grub.

Hemi sat at the end of the table with Shakes electric motor manual open in front of him, eating his rice with one hand while scribbling down notes in the other.

Their hunger got the better of any conversation for a few minutes as they moved mounds of rice, egg, and cabbage. Gregory served himself and sat down, and got back up a few minutes later to fry another egg for Owen when he arrived. A few minutes later had to get up to make Shakes another egg. All told, every one of them had at least two servings and Owen and Shakes each ate three servings apiece. Gregory never got to sit for more than a minute, and when no more eggs were being demanded, he got up again to put coffee on.

Between forkfuls of rice, Percy tried to get an assessment of the situation on her boat. "Owen, have you been down in the cargo hold?" Owen nodded, his crop fully loaded. "How's the patch looking?"

Owen swallowed, and then swallowed again. "I'm hardly an expert on welding or repairs, but I'd say it looks pretty bad. The patches are an ugly mess, and I'm pretty sure the water level is rising again, though slowly."

"Can you work on it? Can you clean up those welds, get the leaking stopped?" Percy asked.

"I can try. But you know it's delicate work that I'm just starting to figure out. There's a chance I could just make it worse --- burn a hole right through the hull. If you ask me, I think you need Chips to keep working on it."

Hemi looked at his food instead of the manual. Percy ground her fork against her tin plate. "I didn't ask your fucking opinion ya little shit. I asked if you can fix it."

"Yeah, Percy. No sweat." Owen poked at his food a little less hungrily.

"Finish your food and get your skinny ass back down there."

"Percy," Hemi said, not looking up from his food. "I really think you need to do what you can to get Chips back down there and welding."

She pounded the table, and looked up, breathing through her nostrils. "Fuck."


### A plan

Owen took his coffee to go, and headed back down to try and keep reinforcing Chips' patch. When the rest of them finally all had a cup of coffee in front of them, and the empty bowls pushed into the middle of the table, Percy brought them to order. "Next agenda item: assuming we don't sink, how to get this boat moving again?"

Hemi put his pencil down. "Maybe some of you are familiar with the Angler fish?" Hemi asked. "In some species the female is enormous compared to the male, maybe like a hundred times bigger. The females are complex, highly evolved organisms, with sophisticated traps for catching and devouring other fish. The males are nothing but tiny sperm repositories. They swim around until they find a female, attach themselves to the female's underside, and then fuse with her body, essentially becoming nothing but a sperm organ for her."

"Hemi, let's try stepping around the metaphor and getting to the point." Said Captain Percy.

"Here's what I propose," continued Hemi, "The _Prospect_ has a hatch with a mating collar on the bottom side of the boat. Normally we use that for underwater docking in situations where we need to dock on someone's topside hatch. We could rig something so we could mate the _Gnat_ to the underside of the _Prospect_, and then feed up fuel and power into the _Prospect_ from the _Gnat_. Kinda like a male anglerfish..."

"Got it." Percy interrupted. "And you think there's enough juice left in the _Gnat_ to take us both to the depot like that?"

"We have to cut everything to the bone, but the math says we could make it. _Could_."

"And what the fuck do I get from your biology lesson?" Asked Shakes. "This plan is really me casting my lot in with you losers. Basically I'm donating all my fuel to you and hoping I can piggyback in, right?"

"We can pay you for the fuel Shakes." Said Percy.

"Plus we'll be fitting a nice mating collar onto the _Gnat_, you might find some use for that in the future." Said Hemi. "Think of it as a deluxe feature."

"And hot meals for til we get to the depot. I got a propane stove stowed somewhere, so we don't have to waste any more precious electricity on cooking." Added Gregory.

Shakes, perhaps more driven by his stomach than he cared to admit, considered. "I want double the value of the fuel."

"Absolutely." Said Percy.

"And you're buying a dinner of _good_ food at the depot."

"Done." Said Percy.

"And... I want you to keep a line open to me on any future job possibilities."

"What.. like partners?" Bristled Percy.

"Fuck no. I work alone. But a man has to have a network in this game. I want you to be a big node on my network, feeding me future prospects."

"Alright. Any job that seems suitable for a specialty cargo hauler like yourself, I will happily send your way."

Shakes grinned. Now they were working in a space he understood --- the most profit came from future options. "So Hemi, what exactly are you going to do to my beautiful boat?"

"Well," he said, looking at Percy, "first, we gotta rouse Chips. She's the only one on board who might know how to fit a mating collar that could work."

Percy was holding her fork in her fist, and grinding the tines back and forth against the tin plate, leaving deepening lines of scratches. Percy and Shakes both looked at her. "Alright, Fuck. Hemi, go see if you can rehire Chips on a _temporary_ and ad hoc basis to do some of this welding we need. I don't want to see her though, keep her out of my way or I might bodily throw her off the boat."


### They reconcile with Chips and talk about fitting mating collar to the Gnat

Hemi loaded up another bowl of rice and led Shakes to the crew quarters where they found Chips in her rack with the curtains drawn. 

"Chips," Hemi addressed the curtain, "I brought you some food, ya want it?"

"Ah fuck you and your gestures Hem'," came a muffled voice from behind the curtain. "Go spoon it into that twat you work for until she chokes on it."

"Look Chips, you're a tough one, no one would deny that. And I think that toughness comes partly from a genuine mean streak in you, and partly from the fact that you believe you know how to do things right. Problem is that Percy has both of those qualities too, so just like you she's mean and not going to be the one to admit when she did something wrong."

"Spare me the fuckin' you're-both-so-fuckin'-alike speech Hemi! Just fuck off."

"I'm just saying _why_ she's not going to come apologize, Chips. I'm also saying I totally think she was wrong, and risked your life by not warning you she was going to blow the tanks. You were right, and she _should_ apologize, but you know her --- she won't."

"So fuckin' what? You think I care?"

"So I don't think you want to die out here just because she's too thick-headed to admit you were right. But that's what's going to happen Chips: we're going to sink and die on this ocean right here if you don't help us out. We need you to help keep the welds on that patch of yours together. Please."

There was a silence. Then a small, dirty hand stuck out from behind the curtain. "Give me that food, I'm starving." Hemi put the warm bowl of rice into the hand, and it withdrew. There was a clinking of the fork for a minute, and then Chips opened the curtain a little so she could look at Hemi so she could talk to him while she ate. That's when she saw Shakes. "Who the fuck is that?"

"I'm fuckin' Shakes." Said Shakes.

"Is that your name or how you reproduce?" Asked Chips.

"Didn't they call you 'Chips'?"

"Look," Hemi interrupted, "we found Shakes here on the surface. He's got a boat --- a small boat. I want to weld a mating collar onto the sail of his boat. It has to fit to the _Prospect's_ bottom mating collar. I want to attach his boat to the underside, and run with it like that and this is another project we can't do without you. Think you could rig something like that up?"

"Well fuck. I might have some spare steel that could do that. Depends on what the hatch on his boat looks like, so I'll have to eyeball that. Possible it could be done. But that's a fuckin' tricky bit of sonar listening to mate to that, steerin' the boat up from underneath, like. You think you can fuckin' do that Shakes?"

"I've squeezed that boat through some narrow fuckin' gaps when pushing through Authority fencing. I'm as good a small-boat pilot as there ever was."

"His boat, The _Gnat_, has a view port in the sail. He should be able to see where he is to do the mating maneuver without sonar." Said Hemi.

"A fuckin' window on a submarine. Stupidest fuckin' thing I ever heard. Fuckin' crazy shit ya want to pull here. Look Hem', you're right about me not wanting to die out here. Way I figure it is to best push that priority forward, I gotta spend my time workin' on my fucking patch in the cargo hold. I may spend the rest of my life working on that fuckin' patch, really. I ain't got time to be up there fuckin' around with welding scrap steel onto what, and I'm just taking a wild fucking guess here, is some barely-afloat rusting sea-tractor." She paused. "You might get Owen to fuckin' do it."

"The kid?" Asked Shakes, "Fuck that. If there's welding to be done, I'll weld my own fucking boat."

"She's right though." Said Hemi. "The patch in the _Prospect_ needs more work. If it fails, it could take both boats down. Before you do go back to your patch though Chips, get Owen and go out with Shakes and take a look at the _Gnat_. Make sure he has what he needs to get this done right. It isn't going to help us much if the mating collar leaks and floods the _Gnat_. Have Owen haul up the spare welding rig." 

"Ay Hem." She said, understanding that what Hemi really meant was she should tell Shakes how to do it right. She swung down from her bunk handing Hemi her empty food bowl. "Let's go find Owen, and have a look at this boat of yours." She said to Shakes.


### Hemi and Percy put someone on radar

Hemi found Percy sitting at the sonar station with the headset on, listening. When she saw Hemi, she pulled one earpiece off. "That go OK?"

"Yeah, Shakes says he is going to do the welding on the _Gnat_, Chips wants to keep working on the _Prospect's_ patch."

"Thank god she came to her senses."

"Her senses had little to do with it."

Percy ignored that. "What's next?"

"I wanted to look at the chart and run my numbers again."

"Alright. We should put someone on radar, I don't want any Authority craft sneaking up on us."

"Put Gregory or Bastian on it." 

"Yeah. Alright, I'll get Bastian in here. Better than nobody."

"Send Gregory out to help Owen and Shakes. That's going to be a bit of a tricky operation."

"Good idea." Captain Percy headed to the galley to rouse the guys from their cold and empty coffee cups.


### Back on deck, with the cargo hold hatch open, lifting the welding rig and welding the Gnat mating collar

On the deck of the _Prospect_ Owen had lifted the big cargo hatch, which opened a gaping hole down into the big space of the cargo hold. It was the only way to get a heavy welding rig out of the boat. He had assembled a tripod gantry over the hole, from which was hanging a heavy block with a chain running through it. Gregory was down in the cargo hold hooking the end of the chain to a welding rig. When he had it secured Gregory gave Owen the thumbs up.

"Hey Gregory," Owen called down to him, "while I'm hauling the welding rig up look around: we still need the material for the mating collar, the gangway so I can wheel this fucking thing across to the _Gnat_, heavy clamps, and a welding mask." Owen looked across at the deck of the _Gnat_ with the chop washing over it. "Uh, better get those rubber waders too." He lit a cigarette and started hauling the welding rig up, hand-over-hand. "This isn't going to be fucking easy." He said to himself through the cigarette hanging from his lips.

When he got the welding rig suspended over the deck, he gave it a little kick, and when it swung back he let the chain out and grabbed the rig as it touched the deck and tilted back toward the hole. This was really a two-person job, a mistake would mean a 10 meter drop into the cargo hold. Chips and Shakes were over on the deck of the _Gnat_ drawing lines on the top of the sail with a grease pencil. Transport subs were perpetually under-crewed leaving a lot of work to be done by individuals that would be a lot safer with a few more people helping out.

Owen wheeled the weldling rig out of the way and aligned its wheels with the deck of the _Prospect_ so it wouldn't tilt off into the ocean. By the time he got back over the big open cargo hatch, Gregory was back underneath with the gangway. Lashed to the railings of the gangway were the various other things Owen had asked for. Owen dropped the end of the chain down to him, and Gregory clipped it to one end of the gangway. "Hold on, I'll come up and help you haul it up." And he disappeared.

With Gregory helping to pull the chain through the block, they hauled the gangway vertically up to the mouth of the cargo hatch, out onto the deck, and got it lashed into place connecting the higher deck of the _Prospect_ to the low, wet deck of the _Gnat_.


### They plan the mating collar

Chips waved Owen over. "Thanks for fuckin' doing that gangway. It'll be a lot easier gettin' back to the _Prospect_." She grinned her rarely-seen wide-mouthed grin at Owen. "Alright, look here, this is the plan Shakes and I get worked out, and ya should be glad Shakes is doing it. It's going to be a fuckin' nightmare if it works, and like a fuckin' wet, squirtin', languish in the head if it don't." She pointed to the top of the sail. "We fuckin' lucked out though, Shakes here made the sail fat enough that we can make the welds fuckin' flat. Ya just need a piece of steel cylinder cut even, then weld it around the hatch opening, and then weld the spare male docking clamps we got onto the sides of the fuckin' cylinder."

"How're you going to activate the docking clamps?" Asked Owen. "They're electro-magnetic, right?."

"Yeah," said Shakes, "we'll need to drill some through-hull fittings. That sucks, but it shouldn't be too hard to make them water-tight to 30 meters, which is what I usually call the depth limit of the _Gnat_. And if the do happen to leak... well, they'll be pretty small leaks. A boat that doesn't leak isn't a boat, it's like, an airplane, or something."

"Since we're going to be dragging the _Gnat_ along by the mating collar," said Owen, "Seems like ya should also weld some supports on the outside of the collar, down the sail, and directly to the structural elements of the hull. It'll be ugly as fuck, but less likely to leave the _Gnat_ ripped away from the collar." 

"Ugly-as-fuck is my other name." Said Shakes.

"Listen to the kid, Shakes. He's gettin a touch for this stuff." Said Chips.

"Hey, offer all the advice you want, but I'm the one who puts the torch to my boat, ya?"

"Good by fuckin' me. I'll leave ya stupid fuckers too it. I got me own welding to do." Said Chips, giving them a casual salute and heading up the gangway to the _Prospect_.

"We'll need some other pieces of steel to make this work, I'll get Gregory digging them up." Said Owen.


### They weld the mating collar

This was going to be an extremely tough job. Not as tough as welding the pressure hull back together under water --- Owen reminded himself --- but nobody would do this job if they didn't have to. Owen had wheeled the welding rig across the gangway, and that  had only been modestly harrowing. Lashing it to the sloshing hull of the _Gnat_ had been somewhat more so. Owen set Shakes up with everything he needed, like a nurse handing a surgeon the tools for opening a consumptive ribcage.

The ocean chop wasn't horrendous, but it was enough that the _Gnat_ rolled back and forth under them. Owen had locked huge clamps in place that held the work material to the sail. The water washing over the deck would sometimes smack up against the sail and shoot up right where Shakes would be welding.

Shakes stood astride his boat at precisely sea-level in the same way one might stand on a mountain top. He took a pinch of dried leaves from the pouch in his jack pocket and stuck them between his teeth. He lit a cigarette, and put it to his lips. He put the mask on his head, and slipped the heavy welding gloves onto his hands. He picked up the torch, and standing straight up, opened his arms wide and closed his eyes. He took long slow breathes, gapping his lips next to his cigarette, and his breaths rattling a little with the spittle coming up to enzymatically dismantle the dried leaves. He cleared his mind, focussed on his breathing. He felt the swell and rhythm of the ocean, the time of it marked out by the clink of the adjustable wrenches hanging from his belt. He called the gods of steady hands and perfect welds to him.

He opened his eyes, spit the remaining half of cigarette off into the ocean, leaned over, and flipped the welding mask down. 

He proceeded to lay down the foulest globbing booger weld Owen had ever seen. Smoking mass of material built up on top of smoking mass, curled over, and gooped around in carbon-coated black curves. Shakes gripped the welding stick fiercely, the muscles of his forearms tensed up. The tip wavered back and forth across the line the weld was supposed to follow that it looked like he might be trying to sign the work rather than repair it.

"Jesus fucking Christ." Said Owen quietly.

Shakes welded, went back over his work, and welded more. It grew uglier and uglier, globs upon globs of congealed molten metal. The wash continually soaked the two men in cold water. Shakes had to constantly stop welding so Owen could move the clamps. Since the seam needed to be watertight, Owen wanted to keep it press-fit in place with the clamps at all times. Owen knew that that starting and stopping like that was bad for a welder who wanted to make a clean, strong weld. But since Shake's welds were about the worst he'd ever seen, that seemed like the least of his problems. The hot welds steamed when the water ran over them, which Owen was pretty sure would not contribute the strength of the weld.

"You... built this boat?" Owen asked Shakes, when he raised his head up for a break. 

"Ay ya. On a mountain top."

"And... it doesn't leak... too much?"

"Ah well, ye know there's always gonna be 'nother leak. I just patch em and keep fuckin' movin'."

"Lot of patches?"

"Sometimes it seems like it's more patch than original boat. But then, since the boat was built from scraps, it has always been a fuckin' quilty kinda thing."

By the time they finished welding the support struts down the side of the hull, the new mating collar looked like a bipedal birthday cake, frosted by a toddler using a mixture of coke and pitch. 

"You think that'll hold?" Owen asked looking at the mess doubtfully.

"Ah hell's ya. Look at how much material we welded into that thing! See, an engineer can build a thing to an exact fuckin' spec and if they're a good enginer that thing will perform they way they expect it to, in all the situations they expect it to. The thing is, that don't mean it will perform in situations the engineer _don't_ expect. That's why I always _overbuild_ things, far beyond any spec --- so I'll be ready for what I doesn't expect."

Owen wheedled his way up and down following the thread of that logic, and eventually decided it made absolute sense. "Well, nothing like holding a welding project underwater and dragging it along at a few knots to test the quality of your work."

"Ay that's fer fuckin' sure. Why don't ya go tell that big Hemi guy we're ready here."


### They lower the boat

Getting all the gear from the welding operation stowed back in the cargo hold took longer than expected. The chop was building a bit, and that made anything aboard the _Gnat_ difficult to do. Once Hemi saw all the odds and ends lowered back below, and checked the main cargo hatch seal, he went to the forward end of the cargo hold to check on Chips work.  She was welding yet more scraps of metal patches over the still-leaking wound in the pressure hull. Thankfully the water level was at least down enough that Chips was wading it it instead of swimming in it. 

Captain Percy came walking down the cargo hold and met up with Hemi standing at water's edge in the forward end. Chips looked up when she arrived and glared at her, but went immediately back to her welding.

"We're ready to try this connecting up the _Gnat_ move." Hemi said to Percy when she stood next to him.

"Good." Said Percy, through an exhale of her cigarillo smoke. Her eyes were bloodshot and her entire face drooping and wane from lack of sleep. She had another cup of coffee in her other hand. "Need any else the from me when you try the mating?"

"I don't think so. But I think it will go easier a lot easier for Shakes if we can put the _Prospect_ in motion, and lower the deck under, just run sail-up. At that depth the waves will have a lot less affect on the motion of the boat." Chips looked up from her work again when she heard this.

"Do we have the battery life left for that?"

"Ten minutes at a creep speed maybe? I think we can just manage it. I'm more worried about whether we have enough control over the buoyancy to take her down like that."

"But if we can run sail-up, we'll also be also be much harder to spot target as we head for the depot."

"Ah fuck ya both, ya weeping cunts!" Chips interrupted from where she was standing in the water. "Yer determined to sink us! Are ya forgetting the high-pressure system's depleted? I doubt there's enough fuckin' pressure left for a full blow if something goes wrong. Fuck --- there's probably also not enough fuckin' power in the batteries to bring us back to the surface with the fuckin' low-pressure system! We'll be lucky to fuckin be leapin' out the top of the sail as it lowers away under us heading for the bottom!"

Captain Percy just stared down into her coffee cup.

"I agree, Chips," Said Hemi, "it's dangerous. But so is running slow with engines blaring full-up on the surface if we manage to get the _Gnat_ attached. We'll be a big fat radar _and_ sonar target. We need the stealth lowering the boat down will give us."

"Ay well, yer both fuckin' suicidal, and murder-fucking-cidal --- since yer trying to drag me down against my will. To lower the boat you gotta open the main ballast valves of course. What the fuck happens if they don't fuckin' close again though, eh? Then we are just letting all the fucking buoyancy out of the boat with no way to put it back."

"There's no reason to think they won't." Said Hemi. 

"And you'll go double-check those fucking things our lives depend on before we try this operation." Said Percy, her eyes grinding away at Chips.

"The fuckin' problem," Said Chips, furious and exasperated, "is there's no fucking back-up plan --- no failsafe, no redundancy. The boat works perfect like, or we all fuckin' die. Submarinin' is just too fuckin' dangerous with no backup-system."

"We're not disputing that Chips. But sinking is only one risk we face right now." Said Hemi as calm as always. "Go check the ballast tank valves --- make sure you're confident they will work they way they are supposed to. When you're happy with them, let me know, and we'll put the top deck underwater."


### Explaining the mating procedure

Ten minutes later Chips climbed up into the control room and reported to Hemi, through many curses, that the main ballast valves were working as expected. Hemi checked over the state of their batteries and other systems, and noted everything with a pencil on a clipboard. He got on the external PA and called Shakes to the control room.

Two minutes later Shakes' was on the bridge at the top of the _Prospect's_ sail. He looked down at Hemi through the open hatch into the control room and called to him.

"Ya fuckin' ready Hemi?"

"Just about. I need you to take the _Gnat_ off a hundred meters or so. We're going to bring the _Prospect_ down to just sail-out, and creep at two knots. We'll hold it steady. Then it's all you: dive the _Gnat_, come up underneath, you should see the mating collar just about under where the sail would be on the bottom --- about one-third of the way forward from the stern. Bring the _Gnat_ up under, and _gently_ pop your mating collar into ours, and if you boys didn't miss on the location of the docking clamps by too much, you should be able to lock into the hull of the _Prospect_... like a male angler fish."

Shakes gave him the finger.

"When you are clamped on, bang on your hatch with one of those wrenches of yours. I'll have Gregory down there waiting to hear from you. Do _not_ open the hatch til Gregory bangs back, ok? Even in its current condition, the _Prospect_ will do better if your welds leak than the _Gnat_ will. Keep in touch over the ship-to-ship."

Shakes pounded his acknowledgement on the side of the sail, and his head disappeared from the bridge. It was still so quiet aboard the _Prospect_ with no engines and so few systems running that they could hear the _Gnat's_ Diesels fire up, and inarticulate shouts from Shakes to Gregory on the deck as Shakes cast off the lines and Gregory retrieved them and pulled up the bumpers.

"Hey-ut!" Shakes voice came crackling over the ship-to-ship. "I'm fired up, buttoned up, and off motoring. Out."

Hemi pulled down the ship-to-ship mic. "Got ya Shakes. Remember, _gentle_ is the word."

"I'm allllways fuckin' gentle."

"We're going to take the _Prospect_ down to sail-out depth now. Hold tight til I give you the go."


### they dive to sail-out depth

Hemi got on the boat PA, and flipped the switch for both internal and external speakers. "Gregory, lock down all the external hatches as you come back inside. Owen and Bastian, come up to the control room, we're going to dive the boat to sail-out depth."

Moments later the entire crew converged on the control room. Gregory was climbing down from the sail, sealing the hatch above his head, Bastian and Owen were climbing up the ladder into the control room, and Chips arrived in the navigation and sonar compartment just under the control room with Captain Percy.

Captain Percy looked at Chips with the obvious unspoken question: why the fuck are you here? "If we fuckin' go down, I want to be here to say I told you fuckin' so." Said Chips.

"Chips, those are the 'bon voyage' words of every trip to hell." Replied Percy. "If you're gonna be up here, sit at radar and let us know if we're going to have a surprise audience for this fucking operation." 

Captain Percy waited for Gregory to climb down from the control room  --- on his way to the bottom hatch on the lowest deck of the boat with his instructions from Hemi --- before she climbed up into the control room which was now cramped up again with its full compliment of four people.

"OK, Bastian. Give us a 2 knot creep. We want just enough to keep us steady against the motion of the water." Said Hemi. 

Bastian nudged the throttle forward, and they heard the soft hum of the electric motor as it put the propeller under torque. 

Hemi pulled at the ship-to-ship mic. "Shakes, we're going to try this shallow dive now. If you see the sail disappear, this boat is never coming back up."

"Fucking Right." Shakes voice crackled. "I won't wait around for another meal then."

Hemi hung the mic back up. "OK, you know what they say: always do the stupidest things on the little about of sleep. Owen, open the main ballast valves."

Owen swiveled his chair to face the tank control panel, and turned the small wheels that opened the valves. A burst of air escaped up through the main ballast valves ahead of the sail as sea water pushed up into the ballast tanks from below and displaced the air out through the valves.

"Just a nominal hair of down angle on the dive plane." Said Hemi.

Owen was ready for this, his other hand still on the bigger wheel that controlled the dive planes. He inched it a small way around its circumference.

"As soon as you feel the angle on the boat Owen, level it back out again." By the time Hemi had said this, the _Prospect_ already had a slight angle down on the bow. 

From the radar station below they could hear Chips muttering. "No fuckin' redundant system, nothing at fucking all..."

Owen already had the dive planes leveled out again and the slight angle came off the _Prospect's_ deck. Owen and Hemi were watching the depth gauge closely as it slowly lifted up off it's pin. When it was firmly pointing at one meter of depth, Hemi reached over and closed the main ballast tank valves himself. They all listened for the sound of the hissing, escaping air to stop. No one was breathing as the sound went on longer than it seemed like it should. But it wavered, slowed and stopped as the valves closed.

"Give it another minute... let's make sure everything is where it should be..." Said Hemi. But the boat held at a depth of one meter, the deck fully submerged, but most of the sail still sticking above the surface. Captain Percy reached up to pat Hemi's huge shoulder. In some ways it seemed like such a small thing, a basic maneuver they had done a thousand times before. But Hemi, at least, knew Chips was right, what was usually so routine was, in this case, incredibly risky. He felt a tremendous release of tension that He didn't quite know he had when the main ballast valves closed. Everything had worked the way it was supposed to to.

"Good." Said Percy, satisfied. "We didn't sink her by flooding the main ballast. Now let's see if we can do it by opening a hole in the bottom onto a rusted bucket of a home-made boat."


### Mating the gnat to the prospect

Hemi got back on the ship-to-ship. "Shakes, we're holding at sail-out depth, two-knot forward creep. I think you can begin your dive now."

"Righto." Shakes came Shakes crackling reply.

Captain Percy raised the periscope and swiveled around until she could see the tiny, nearly-invisible gray sail of the _Gnat_ bobbing in the water off their port side. It picked up speed, and a little wake formed behind it. Then it shrank down and disappeared under the surface like a sun winking out at the horizon. She lowered the periscope back down.

"I'm gonna get on sonar." She said. 

Hemi nodded.

Percy slipped down the ladder and tapped Chips on the shoulder. "Chips, I think it would be good if you joined Gregory in the bottom of the boat. Get a welding rig... just in case."

"If you're fuckin' staying in this room, I'm happy to go fuckin' somewhere fucking else." Chips left forward toward the cargo hold to find her welding rig.

Captain Percy sat in the seat Chips vacated and glanced at the empty radar scope to make sure it was staying empty. She put the sonar headphones on, and turned the directional control until she could hear the quiet electric motor of the _Gnat_. Shakes was lining up directly behind the _Prospect_, slightly deeper and with more speed, coming up underneath them. She could follow his progress with a fair amount of precision through the sonar and it's range finder. But he disappeared for a minute when he moved into their wake where the sonar couldn't hear anything. In another minute she expected to hear the _Gnat_ directly underneath the _Prospect_.

On board the _Gnat_ shakes held his head down at a painful angle, trying to see exactly where he was in relation to the hulking gray wall slowly stirring the waters above him.

"Fuuuuuck. They should have mentioned that this would be stupidly fucking dangerous." Said Shakes to himself. "Like a backyard bully in a pool, holding some scrawny kid's head underwater... though I suppose some people must be into that sort of thing."

"Shakes," Hemi's voice came over the ship-to-ship with all the bass notes stripped out of it. "Don't forget that since we're moving, you're going to have to give it a little umph when you get within a meter of the _Prospect_ or so. We're going slow enough that it shouldn't be too dramatic, but you also don't want to get sucked back into the _Prospect's_ propellers."

"Ay, fuck you all." He didn't bother to respond on the radio, his hands too busy with the controls of the _Gnat_. "This little fuckin' boat wasn't built for this shit. Handles like a damn beachball underwater."

He was pushing up from behind, moving slightly faster than the _Prospect_. He could just see the little black circle of the mating collar he was shooting for through his forward view port. He'd lose the ability to see it when he was close to it though. 

He squeezed the ballast blow handle in a very short burst, and the _Gnat_ popped up an entire meter closer to the underside of the _Prospect_. "Ugh, too fuckin' much, too fast. _Gently_, gently..." He got within a meter of the hull of the _Prospect_ and lost sight of the mating collar just as he could feel the push of water from the moving hull of the big boat driving him backwards. It was also totally screwing up his sense of where he was, until the mating collar came into view in front of him.

He gave the _Gnat_ a little more power to the electric motor, and it moved forward through the streaming water. He held very close to the _Prospect_. The _Gnat_ inched slowly forward, the mating collar disappeared over his head again. He angled the small dive planes up a bit, and with a loud clang the mating collars of the two ships collided. Shake visualized what was happening in his head: the two mating collars were pressed against each other, but not aligned. He slowly eased the controls, a little rudder port, a little rudder starboard, a little forward power, a little off the throttle. He was moving the mating collar around in a circle, trying to get it to slip into the _Prospect's_ collar. There was the sound of steel ring grinding on steel ring, until with another big clang, the whole boat popped upwards. 

It felt right. Shakes gave a tiny further squeeze on the main ballast blow so that the _Gnat_ would have good strong upward buoyancy against the bottom of the _Prospect_. He was pretty sure the two rings were mated, but the way to know for sure was the docking clamps. He flipped the exposed switch he and Owen had installed, and with a little blue electric spark connected the circuit that ran up the heavy wires through the holes they had drilled and sealed into the sail to the mating clamps. He heard a third loud clang, and a green light next to the switch lit. If he had missed the docking collar, the clamps wouldn't have closed, so he was on. To be sure he disengaged the electric motor to let the prop spin freely. When he did so, he could feel the bow of the _Gnat_ bend down small amount in a sickening way, but the speed indicator didn't change. The _Gnat_ was being dragged by the _Prospect_. 

He picked up the ship-to-ship. "Hemi, I think I'm on."

"Ya, we can see the drag up here. We're going to trim our tanks to adjust for the _Gnat_ hanging on, and then shut down our engines to save our batteries. Give a bang on your hatch and let's try opening it up."


### The hatch needs to be repaired

In the deepest part of the _Prospect_, a narrow hall between the forward and rear battery rooms that had heavy water-tight bulkhead doors on either side, Gregory and Chips sat on the floor grating on either side of a well where they had pulled up the grating between them. Their feet dangled down into the well and Gregory tapped his toes lightly on the still-closed hatch while they waited for the signal from Shakes.

Gregory seemed a little nervous. "Ehhh, Chips, should we close and seal this watertight bulkhead door behind me here? Seems like if Shakes' welds fail completely when we open this hatch --- and worse case, maybe the _Gnat_ tears the fuck away or something --- we'll be flooding the whole fucking _Prospect_ from this hole we're opening in the bottom of the boat, eh?"

"I got my fucking bulkhead hatch closed and fuckin' sealed on this side. If it starts fuckin' flooding fast, we are going out your door and sealing it fuckin' behind us. There's no fuckin' way we're sealing our fuckin' selves in here and risking being fuckin' heroes to save this damned ship."

"Alright, I'm following you then Chips."

"Keep that fucking portable bilge pump ready though: if there's a small leak then some modest fuckin' heroics will be required of us."

They could hear the _Gnat_ grinding against the mating collar of the _Prospect_, grating back and forth trying to find the docked position. And then there was the loud crunch of the two boats coming together.

"Sound's like he's fuckin' on." Said Chips. "We wait til we get the OK from fuckin' Hemi though."

Gregory nodded.

They could feel the shuddering vibrations of the _Gnat's_ motor through the hull of the _Prospect_ for a few minutes, and then that died away as Shakes shut it down. A few moments later the _Prospect's_ motors shut down too. They heard Shakes bang out shave-and-a-haircut on the top hatch of the _Gnat_ --- below the still-closed bottom hatch of the _Prospect_ --- with one of his wrenches, and then it was quite silent til Hemi came crackling over the ship PA. "OK Chips, open it up."

Chips nodded to Gregory, and he reached down into the hatch well, and cranked open the sealing wheel. He pulled up the hatch and water steadily flooded up around their feet. Gregory jumped up, as if bitten. But Chips lay out flat on the grating, and reached her hand down into the pool of water. She felt along the welds until she could feel water pushing in.

"The welds are _mostly_ not totally fucking failing. But you can see it's leaking." Said Chips. "Get the fuckin' pump hooked up Gregory, and let's get as much of this fucking water out of here as fucking possible. Then I'll see if I can weld it decent fuckin' like."

While Gregory got the hoses for the bilge pump connected, she got on the PA with Hemi. "We gotta fucking fix these shitty fuckin' welds or it'll flood the fucking _Gnat_ when we open its fuckin' hatch Hemi. Tell Shakes to sit fuckin' tight, and not to do a fuckin' thing." Hemi acknowledged, and she started putting her welding gear on.

It was cold, frustrating, cramped work. But such had been all of Chips work on this trip, maybe her whole life. She let out a never-slowing stream of curses, attempting to damn down to a permanent watery hell not just all materials and work processes, but all the societal systems and turns of fate that had conspired against her to bring her to this particular misery. 

Shakes' welds were horrifically ugly, like stitch work on a revivified 19th Century monster. Stopping the leaks required hammering metal sheet patches into place, and welding them until they didn't leak. Chips felt lucky when the leaking was starting to slow and she hadn't cut through the mating ring or the hull of the _Gnat_ and made the situation even worse.

Eventually no more water seeped in though, and the pump sucked the last of the water out the well, leaving them looking at the recessed domed top hatch of the _Gnat_. The whole mess was holding, though Chips thought she would never want to test it at any depth deeper than they already were.

Chips banged on the hatch with the end of the welding stick. "Eh Shakes ya fucker. You can open this fucker up now." She yelled into the empty metal well, her voice bouncing the curses back at her. There was the sound of the rusty sealing gears squeaking open and the hatch lifted up. 

Shakes was grinning up at them as residual water dripped down on him. "Who's a fuckin' anglerfish now, eh motherfuckers?"

"Don't touch them fucking welds when ya come through, the fuckers are still fuckin' hot."

Shakes put his arms up through the hatch hole, found a place to grab that wasn't warm from welding, lifted his foot to some footing in the sail of the _Gnat_, and stepped up into the _Prospect_. Gregory pushed the ship intercom button and told Hemi they had Shakes aboard. 

"Right. _Now_ the hard part." Said Hemi over the intercom. Then got on the ship PA, and asked everyone to meet him down at the hatch to the _Gnat_.


### Rigging up power to the Prospect

"So basically we're going to suck the life out of the _Gnat_ to keep the _Prospect_ going." Hemi told them all when they were all crammed in, assembled on both sides of the open hatch to the _Gnat_ below. 

Shakes squirmed. 

"I'm going to set up some heavy jumpers between the _Gnat's_ battery banks and the battery rooms of the _Prospect_ where y'all are standing in right now. That should be pretty straightforward, and give us access to the _Gnat's_ remaining battery power. Not much, in terms of the _Prospect's_ power consumption.

"Chips, I need you to do the harder part and figure out how to get the fuel left in the _Gnat_ into the _Prospect's_ engines. I'm not sure if it's better to try to pump it up into the _Prospect's_ fuels tanks, or run it straight from the _Gnat's_ fuel tanks to the _Prospect's_ diesels."

"Be fuckin' easier to just run a long hose up to the fuckin' _Prospect's_ fuckin' fuel pumps. Won't have to fuck around with the trim as much." Put in Chips.

"If you think that'll work, it sounds OK to me." Said Hemi. "Cap, you want to weigh in with anything?"

"This fucking project is all you, Hem'." Said Captain Percy.

"From this moment on, we need to shut down absolutely everything we aren't using. We should have been doing this already. We'll need every bit of power we can suck out of the _Gnat_ to get across the Authority line into vaguely friendlier waters. I'm even shutting down all the lighting, so you'll all need to carry light around with you. The good news is, if we get the diesels going, you can all take some rotations in the rack, since there will be no power to do anything else but sleep anyway."

"Chips, you take Owen and Gregory to work on fuel lines. Bastian, we'll go dig up those jumpers. Try to stay out of each other's way everyone." Finished up Hemi. He grabbed Bastian's skinny arm and led him away to stowage where he hoped he could find the long heavy jumper cables he remembered seeing there sometime in the last year.

Chips took Owen and Gregory off to the engine rooms to get the long fuel hoses they normally used for refueling down off their racks on the wall and rigged up through the boat down to the _Gnat_.

Captain Percy looked down at the mess of patches and foul blackened welds that lined the passageway down through the hole in the bottom of her boat, and for a moment couldn't believe they were still afloat. "Shakes," she said to the only person left with her, "let me buy you a cup of coffee."


### Rigged up and running

In a matter of a couple of hours they had a series of umbilicals running through the _Prospect_ and down into the _Gnat_. The big submarine was parasitically sucking the small supply of nutrients the little sub had in reserve: power wired into the _Prospect's_ battery hold so that the _Gnat's_ batteries were now no more than an extra battery hold for the _Prospect_ --- conveniently with a nearly-full charge; and the thick fuel lines ran up to the engine room, where the fuel pumps were engaged and trimmed to gently suck the fuel up from the _Gnat's_ fuel ballast tanks.

To conserve fuel they started only one of the _Prospect's_ multiply redundant diesel engines. And likewise started only one of the electric motors, driving only one of the propellers. This continually pushed them to one side and they had to compensate with some angle on the rudder. Normally they would also be charging the battery banks up while running on diesel, but they needed to put the all the fuel they had into forward motion. It was a filthy inelegant mess, but they were making headway.

Captain Percy insisted everyone who wasn't doing something actively should be in the rack, and Chips, Shakes, and Hemi didn't argue when they were assigned first shift in bed. She had Bastian and Gregory, who were more experienced with the controls of the boat, at the helm seats. They shut down the sonar figuring with the diesel running they wouldn't be able to hear anything until it was too close to do anything about it anyway, considering they couldn't dive or really perform any other evasive maneuver.

But Percy put Own on radar. It would be just stupid to run into a fleet of Authority surface enforcement ships. So Owen sat in the dark with his eye on the glowing radar screen, going a little insane watching it circle around endlessly and reflecting back nothing.

Percy made them all drink two cups of coffee, which she fixed for them in the dark by the light of a penlight.

After a few hours of running like this --- the ship humming and vibrating under them, the superstructure groaning with the stress of dragging along the _Gnat_ and being thrust in one direction by her one turning propeller, and the other direction by her rudder --- Percy decided she needed to see how far they'd gone. At the navigation table, she measured with the calipers and laid down a string of hashed marks from the x marking the spot where they had mated the _Gnat_. 

It was terrifyingly slow going. With the calipers, she spun out the remaining distance to the line Shakes had drawn marking where they would be under a different, hopefully safer,  Authority. She estimated they still had something like eight hours to go. And that was assuming Shakes' line was at all accurate. In addition to just being a rough mark Shakes had laid down from memory, the Authorities might have battled or treatied the line into a totally different part of the ocean for all she knew. They wouldn't be really safe until they were docked at the depot, and even then who knew what the depot folks would be like. Somewhat friendlier to commerce was about all you could hope for with any confidence.

After six hours of non-stop droning darkness, Percy made another pot of coffee, and brought it down to the crew quarters along with a few tin cups tied together with a small bit of wire. She used her flashlight to hunt her relief crew out of their respective racks, and forced coffee into them. Chips strung curses at her, but as red as Chips' eyes were they weren't even close to the bloodshot droop that Percy was dragging around in her eyeballs now.

"Chips, go up and relieve Owen at radar. Hemi you're with me at the controls." Shakes had pulled the blackout curtain aside and was peering blearly down at them and their coffee from a top rack. "Shakes, you can go back to sleep, man."

"No fucking way. My boat's on the line here too. I can help y'all drive this fucking tub of yers."

"I won't insist otherwise. Have a cup of coffee, we'll put you on the throttle/rudder. Shouldn't be much to do there."


### Radar contact with the pursuing sub

With Hemi and Shakes at the controls, and Gregory, Owen, and Bastian stumbling off wearily following the arcs of their flashlights to their racks, Percy lit up a cigarillo, and sat down next to Chips at the radar station. Neither of them said anything, they were both too tired for conversation. It looked like it was taking all of Chips' remaining aggressive energy to keep her eyes following the rotating line of the radar around the scope.

Captain Percy jumped to her feet. Sitting was not going to work, she realized she was falling asleep despite the discomforts of the chair designed to keep you upright and alert. She flicked on her flashlight and leaned over to the navigation table, and again measured the distance to Shakes' imaginary line in the ocean. Their progress was hobbling along.

Chips broke the numbing silence. "Fuckin' got somethin'."

Percy stepped back to the radar/sonar station and leaned over the scope. A small and distant blip was appearing and fading away with each pass of the _Prospect's_ radar. "Fuck. Well, it was probably too fucking much to hope the ocean would remain empty for us. OK, shut down the radar, switch to sonar."

She watched to make sure Chips shut down the radar completely. It was possible for a surface ship to see their radar when it was running and not only discover they were there, but calculate exactly where they were. On the other hand passive sonar was just microphones in the water --- it didn't send any signal out by which they could be tracked. Of course their noisy diesel engine was sending out plenty of sound at the moment, if anyone got close enough to listen for it.

"Won't be able to hear fuckin' much on sonar with the fuckin' diesel running.

"That's why you're going to have to really fucking focus, try to pick out any change in mechanical sound above the diesel. If you think you hear something, we'll shut it down and have a quiet listen. Otherwise we'll stop every half hour or so and see if we hear anyone coming towards us. Can you handle that Chips without fucking blowing up?"

Chips groaned. "Ya fuckin' smart fuckin' pisswad."

Percy pointed her flashlight towards the galley. "Have another coffee Chips."

Captain Percy called to Hemi through the hatch up to the control room. When his face appeared squinting into the beam of her light, she told him they had a distant contact and had shut down the radar and switched to sonar, and that he should be ready to shut down the diesel on notice. He nodded and headed back to the dive plane and tank controls.

While Chips was in the galley setting up some coffee, Percy sat down at the sonar station and put the headset over her ears. The headset was full of the heavy droning hum of the diesel engine, moderated by some swish of water running along the hull and grinding against the sail of the _Prospect_ where it split through the surface.

Captain Percy flipped some switches to engage filters, and the texture of the sound in her ears changed. She blocked out some of the lower frequencies of the engine, and tried to imagine if she could hear the higher pitch of a ship screw spinning in the water. But the sound was relentlessly undifferentiated and unchanging.

Chips came back holding a tin coffee cup. She put on the second sonar headset and remained standing a few steps from where Percy was sitting.

After half an hour or so, Percy called up to Hemi to shut down the diesels so they could have a listen, and a minute later a blessed silence came into the headset. A unsuppressible feeling of relief flowed through her as the silence filled her ears. Sometimes she wondered if the eternal hum of machines that accompanied life aboard a submarine subtly and slowly ate away at her soul. On top of the silence, there was no apparent sound of any other ships in sonar range. Percy flipped through a few filters, and the quality of the silence changed, from a deadening whoosh to a soft hiss. 

And then she heard a pulse. A distant, faint heartbeat in the ocean, accompanied by the slushing flow of circulation. She touched Chips arm, pointed to the softly fluttering signal-strength gauge.

"Ay." Confirmed Chips. "That's the right direction for our fuckin' contact. They just fuckin' moved into fucking sonar range."

"Fuck. We're gonna have to do something. Stay on it Chips."

"Fuckin' ay."

Percy scaled the ladder up to the control room, and raised the periscope, twisting it around as it rose to aim it at the heading of the contact, somewhere on their rear starboard quarter. She didn't expect to see anything, and she did not --- the distance was still too far. But a visual check was the practical and right thing to do first. She lowered the periscope.


### They submerge to periscope depth

"Hemi," Percy hesitated, "I think we gotta fucking submerge to periscope depth --- get the sail underwater --- and run on the _Gnat's_ remaining batteries. How long can we fucking last like that?"

"Well, putting aside the risk of again opening the main ballast valves to bring us lower in the water, the _Gnat_ has maybe an hour of battery we could use at this super slow creep rate we're going at. And I should also point out that when that's gone, we have no other way to hide if we don't lose this contact, or if we do come across another."

"I know. I'm going on instinct here, and fuck me if I'm wrong. Especially considering I haven't slept in days and my head is fucking killing me from eight cups of coffee a day. But I got a sense we don't want to see that fucker coming towards us up there."

"Or, we don't want them to see us, you mean."

"Right."

Hemi nodded. "Alright. I'll open the main ballast valves." He reached up and pushed the dive alarm.

"Ah fuck ya all," Chips yelled up to them, pulling one earpiece of the headset off her ear when she heard the dive alarm, "yer fucking taking us down to periscope depth, ain't ya? We can't run the diesels at periscope, there's no way to feed 'em oxygen. So how the fuck are ya planning to get back on the surface if the batteries fucking die, eh? We'll have no way to steer the boat up to the surface, and we got no fuckin' way to pump the water out! We'll just be fucking sitting there with one fucking eyeball view above the surface, effectively fucking drowned."

"Thank you for keeping us apprised of the risks Chips. I'm still the fucking captain though." Percy yelled back. "Hemi, take us down to periscope."

Hemi flipped up the main ballast valve switches and there was again a rush of air as more of it was released from the top of the ballast tanks, and water eased in from the vents open to the sea on the bottom. Hemi watched the glowing depth gauge until the needle got into the range marked 'periscope,' and then flipped the ballast valve switches down again. There was a clink and the rush of air and water stopped.

"See Chips, the fucking valves are still working as they are supposed to, which we knew because of your inspection earlier. We aren't fucking sunk yet."

"Depends on what ya fuckin' mean by 'sunk'." Said Chips quietly to the sonar station.

"We can't afford to take an evasive route to the depot Hemi, we gotta go straight at 'em. So we'll just have to hope our contact up there wasn't able to track us long enough to figure out our course. Put us back on the electric motor --- they won't be able to hear us unless they get right on top of us." Said Percy. "Um... also keep what Chips said in mind --- make sure we have a little something left in the batteries to get us back to the surface."

"These battery gauges are hardly very precise Percy. I would not push it beyond ten minutes remaining on the battery." Said Hemi.

"Make sure I know when we're about 20 minutes from empty batteries." Said Percy. She raised the periscope and aimed it again in the direction of the contact they had heard on sonar.


### Tracking the contact moving towards them

Sometimes new crew members thought it must be something of a mental relief to be able to look through the periscope after days or weeks inside a submarine --- the opportunity to have even a brief glimpse of the surface world. Captain Percy remembered believing this herself when she first started working on submarines as a teenager. And honestly, she would give her crew shifts on the periscope if she believed it would actually help keep them mentally steady. But the control room was already cramped, and more than that, she knew from years of experience sighting through periscopes that it didn't help. Sometimes it made the claustrophobia of the sub worse. At periscope depth, the viewport end of the device couldn't be more than a meter or two above the surface. There was rarely anything to see except a world entirely made up of an undifferentiated horizon of lighter gray against dark gray. It was almost always like that, and this moment was no exception.

On the surface, it was night. A waning moon above the cloud layer meant there was enough light to see the ocean swells. The swells were moderately significant, which was good --- the _Prospect_ would be harder to hear on sonar and almost impossible to spot visually. Through the scope Percy watched the black swells rise and fall around her, pushing up and easing down the lighter gray field of the sky with a tuned cadence. It was a little dizzying and almost nauseating. Every so often the swell would pass over the top of the periscope and she would have a few seconds of blackness as a relief.

"Chips!" Percy gave her voice a little more emphasis because she didn't remove her face from the periscope frame. "Make sure you stay on that fucking sonar contact. Track the direction and range. Let me know if they get within something like visual range."

"Ay, I'ma fuckin' trackin' their fucking course already. Fuckin surprise! They're fucking coming towards us. Still out ten fuckin' miles or so."

"Fuck." Whispered Percy into the steel column of the periscope in front of her. She swung the scope slowly back and forth across the bearing.

Minutes passed in silence, except for the faint hum of the one electric motor pushing them forward slowly through the water, and Chips occasionally calling out ranges. The contact was quickly marching towards them.

"Fuckers are moving fast and loud." Called up Chips. "Like they ain't afraid of no fuckin' shit."

"That's how armed ships behave." Said Hemi from the control seat. "Probably caught a whiff of us at a distance, and they are charging fast into a range where they can quiet down and take a listen; try to acquire the sound of our electric motor on sonar."

Deep within Captain Percy she pushed down a primitive instinct urging her to run. A fresh young sub driver might crank on as she could on the throttle to get away from a threat. But evolution had moved submarines toward a different escape tactic: slink away silently. They were in a very, very slow-speed race: get out of range of the pursuer's sonar, as slowly and quietly as possible.

After a few more minutes of staring at black empty sea, seeing nothing and at the same time knowing they were out there, Percy could no longer stand just relying on Chips' range estimates. She lowered the periscope and slipped down the ladder and stepped over to the navigation table. Chips immediately understood what she was doing, and without saying anything handed Percy a piece of scrap paper on which she had written a list of ranges and bearings for the contact in pencil. 

Captain Percy leaned over the navigation table, holding her flashlight pointed at their location on the chart with one hand while reading the markings on Chips' paper and using her other hand to lay down the contact's course and times on the chart with a grease pencil. She then marked out their own progress since they picked up the contact on sonar, but it was so short it almost didn't merit marking on the map.

"Fuck they're moving fast." Said Percy to herself. "We might be able to fucking see them already."

"Fuckin' possible, ya." Agreed Chips.


### Percy sees the sub with the ram through the periscope again

Percy scaled the ladder up to the control room quickly, and raised the periscope, spinning it to look out over their rear quarter as it rose. She scanned for just a moment, and then she saw a long, low dark shadow running across the black surface of the water. It kicked up whitecaps where it plowed through the swells, and left a string of white wake behind it. A large black fin rose from the body of the black shadow and from that fin a soft red glow followed by a long black stream of soot marking it's passage through the air in parallel to the wake it left marking its passage through the water. Even as Percy watched, the red glow faded, and the white wake died away. They were shutting down their diesels so they could hear better.

The pursuing submarine was two or three miles off, and running crosswise across the path the _Prospect_ had traveled along. So from where Percy was she could see the whole length of the boat. And mounted to its bow was the same medieval ramming contraption she had seen before. The same that had ripped a wound in her boat.

"Fuck. It's that same fucking sub that rammed us. Shut down the motor Hemi. We're going silent, and hopefully they'll miss us."

Hemi flipped some switches and the hum of the electric motor died away. Captain Percy watched the sub with the ram through the periscope. They had engaged their own electric motors and were moving forward again. The bow suddenly sunk under the black swells of the ocean, and the rest of the deck followed a few moments later. Streams of misted water were shooting up from its deck as Percy watched the sail sinking into the black line where the surface met the sky.

"They're diving." Percy told Hemi. "Chips! They went down. With our motors off, you should still be able to follow them on sonar. Track 'em, and let me know what the fuck they're doing."

"Ay fuck." Chips called back up from sonar.

Percy let the periscope sink down to its recess.

"Should we get moving?" Hemi asked.

"No. Let's see if we can figure out what they're doing first. We'll hide silently and cower for the moment." Percy lit a cigarillo and pulled at it between her lips. "We'll fuckin' wait."

They waited. It took maybe twenty minutes for Chips to give a report. She called Percy down to the navigation table.

"Fuckin' look here," said Chips "I tracked the fuckers down from where we first fuckin' heard 'em. They shot right to the last location we were running the fuckin' diesels... a few fucking miles behind us now. But, after they submerged, they didn't fuckin' turn to follow us, they turned the other fucking way, and then kept turning." Chips marked out their path in a circle away from them on the chart.

"Fucking search pattern eh?" Said Percy.

"Fuck ya, if I ever seen one. They're lookin' for us, but don't know where to fuckin' look, is my fucking thinking."

"Good. This is our chance. We gotta get out of range before they complete their search circle and start a new circle in our direction." Percy called up to Hemi. "Get us moving again Hem'. Back to a creep, same heading --- toward the depot."


### They try to run from the sub with the ram

The hum of the electric motors came back up, and the _Prospect_ steadily moved on. Percy sat with Chips at the sonar station and listened to the sound of the pursuing sub's screws off in the distance.  The signal grew very weak as the submarine got off to the far end of their search circle, but grew stronger as they returned towards their starting point. Percy continually marked their track on the navigation chart according their range finding calculations.

"We're not out of this yet." Percy said to Chips. "They're moving fast. Makes it easy to fucking track 'em, but their next search circle will almost certainly be the other side of a figure-eight directly the opposite direction of their first --- and directly towards us." Chips nodded. "We gotta be out of range of their search circle before they go past."

"They could fuckin' ping us with active sonar and fuckin' find us that way." Pointed out Chips.

"And they might yet. But they might be not want to risk us being an armed enemy ship. Trying to get a soft sense of their target first, if they can."

"We're fuckin' screwed if they fucking ping us then."

"Hopefully they won't. Give me a new batch of ranges to them." Chips read out the ranges, and Percy marked them down. The sub with the ram had completed their circle, passed through the point they had started at, and had turned in the opposite direction now. "They're coming towards us." Said Percy.


### Percy decides to hold still and wait them out

Captain Percy did some quick math. She knew the pursuing submarine's speed, and in a few minutes of ranges from Chips, she knew the arc of their second search circle. The _Prospect_ was cutting almost directly across that circle, but so slowly compared to the speed of the other sub that there was no way they were going to get out of range in time. At their current rate they might just meet them at the far point of the circle at the same time they arrives. She stood back from the navigation table, holding her flashlight on the chart with one hand and sucking at her cigarillo with the other, the coal glowing in the dark with each puff. She leaned over and put a small x at the _Prospect's_ current location --- almost exactly in the middle of what would eventually be the other sub's completed search circle.

"Hemi," she called up to the control room, "shut her down again. Let's make a hole in the water."

The electric motor died away leaving the _Prospect_ completely silent. Hemi came down from the control room and ran his light over the chart, and immediately understood. "We weren't going to make it outside their search area in time, so instead we'll hide in the middle of it, eh?"

"Could be a stupid move." Percy replied. "Nothing preventing them from fucking taking on a zigzag course all of a sudden."

"We're essentially counting on their sheer sense of symmetry."

"You put it that way it gives me a wisp of hope. Symmetry can be a powerful fucking thing sometimes."

Chips, for once, was not listening to their conversation and instead had both headset pieces over her ears, concentrating on the contact. Every minute or so she scratched down range and bearing data on the finger-stained pad in front of her, while her callused hand slowly slipped the sonar directional wheel along to follow the contact. Percy tapped her on the shoulder, and she pulled back one of the earpieces. "I'm gonna have Hemi take over sonar tracking. We need our best ears for this. Go make sure everyone in the boat knows we need to stay absolutely silent. I don't want anyone deciding now is the time to take a huge shit and start flushing the head repeatedly trying to wash it down."

"Fuck and good riddance. I fucking hate fucking sonar anyway. Melts yer fucking mind into a fucking lump of inanimate fucking rock." She set the headset down and picked up her nearly-empty tin cup of cold coffee and her flashlight and headed forward toward the crew quarters.

Hemi sat down, and slid the sonar headset open as far as it would go before the earpieces went over the ears on his huge head. He handed the paper with Chips' bearings so far listed on it to her. Percy started plotting them down on the chart, the other submarine's search circle making its way steadily around in front of their location.

"Give me bearing and range every minute or so, Hem'." She stretched the second sonar headset wire over to the navigation table, and put an earpiece over one ear so she could hear what Hemi was hearing. She left the other ear open so she could hear Hemi's direction and rage readings.

The boat now was totally silent in a way that only submarines could be. Surface ships were constantly swamped with sound --- water moving, the never-ceasing racket of the wind passing over the boat, and of course the loud rumble of the engines was rarely ever stopped at sea. A submarine was held suspended in a medium that ironically both transmitted sound better than air, but also isolated human ears evolved for sound that moved through air. It was silent enough that Percy could hear Hemi controlling his steady breathing to keep it from impinging on his contact. 

With the boat shut down and nothing to do, Shakes sat on the floor of the control room with his legs dangling down through the hatch, smoking a cigarette. Percy could hear his long draws on the cigarette, and the paper crackling as it was burned away by the coal lighting Shakes' face in the dark.

Hemi had shut off all the filters they normally had to engage on the sonar to filter out any contact signal from their own noise. In the earpiece, Percy could hear an unusually rich cross-spectrum white noise that was the background sound of the deep ocean. Smack in the middle was the whirring and crackling of the contact's propellers stirring through the water. Hemi was extremely good at keeping the sonar mics tracking the source, so they rarely wavered in intensity.The signal was so clear she could almost see the propellers moving, her mind playing a strangely synaesthetic game of converting sound input into a visual stimulation. 

With syncopated regularity, Hemi broke the silence to give her the range and direction. Every time he did, she added a small dash to the chart. The sub with the ram had moved directly in front of them, mere miles away. If the _Prospect_ had still be running her motor, the other sub would definitely have heard them. And if that sub out there was willing to risk an active ping at this range, they would discover the _Prospect's_ location instantly. Percy had her boat hiding in plain sight, in submarine terms. The only tactic they had at the moment was grinding, tense patience.

Percy matched her breathing to Hemi's. She focussed on the sound of the submarine's propellers in her ear piece. She raised up her own calm, and pushed down any fear she had. She slowly grew the dashed line on the chart as it lassoed them in, placing each dash with deliberate care. Each time she put the point down the pencil created a long thin shadow across the chart in the light of her flashlight. The little x marking their location on the chart made it look like she had rendered the eyeball of a cartoon dead man. When the sub with the ram had passed in front of them, and was moving on the final part of the arc to complete their search circle, she decided it was time for them to sneak away.


### They get moving again

She put her hand on Hemi's shoulder and he looked over at her. "Get us moving."

"Same heading --- towards the depot?" Hemi asked.

"It's our only option. Keep it slow and quiet though."

Hemi stood, pulling off the sonar headset. He tapped Shakes on the foot, and Shakes' dangling feet withdrew up into control room. Hemi climbed up and a few moments later, the hum of the _Prospect's_ electric motors returned, accompanied by an extremely mild sensation of acceleration.

Captain Percy stayed at the sonar station. She tracked the progress of the sub with the ram which had begun a third clover-leaf searching circle away from them. That sub was still moving relatively fast, and in 20 minutes they were far enough away that she wasn't able to track them any more over sonar. Their own track on the chart had pushed them out beyond the range of the other sub's circle pattern. It was always possible they would swing back around and intercept them again, but Percy was breathing normally again. Her guts told her they had sneaked out from under that one, though they still had a little ways to go to get across Shakes' supposed Authority control line.


### They go back to sail-up and fire up the diesels

It was not long before Hemi called down to her again. "Captain, we don't have much battery left. Roughly, maybe 20 minutes."

"Fuck." Said Percy, standing at the navigation table, and using calipers to measure their remaining distance to the Authority Control line that Shakes had left on her chart. "We're still at least 10 minutes from getting under that Authority Control line."

"Eh," Shakes called down, "I wouldn't put too much stock in that line. Could be plus or minus by, like, eh, 50 fuckin' miles ya know."

Percy climbed up to the control room. "Wherever the line is, we can't risk staying submerged anymore. Give us some upward dive plane Hemi, put our sail back over the surface. We'll have a good listen and then switch the diesels back on."

Hemi rotated the dive plane angle and indicated to Shakes he should give them just a little bit more throttle. The bow of the _Prospect_ rose, and the depth gauge worked it's way down toward its zero pin. Percy had Hemi go listen on the sonar rig, and when he reported no contacts, she shut down the electric motors, and switched the diesels on. With the extra power of the diesels running, she had them run the air compressors and pump air back into the main ballast tanks and trim tanks until the boat had enough buoyancy to stay at the surface even without the motors pushing them forward and the dive planes driving them upwards.

"With some luck boys, we can be at the depot in a few more hours, and maybe still with a few whiffs of fuel left to pump from the _Gnat_. Shakes, we're gonna owe you big for this." 

"Normally I'd say I'm just happy to help, but fuck that," said Shakes, "y'all sucked the life out of my little boat. A little financial help when we get t' the depot would go a long way..."

"It's going to be something of a layout for us to get the _Prospect_ repaired, refueled, and fitted up for another cargo run. We'll do what we can for the _Gnat_, but don't expect a major reward or anything. It ain't like you rescued some fuckin' Authority oligarchs out there."

"Ya, fuck, I'll keep that in mind next time I stop to kinda help folks in need."

When they crept under where the Authority Control line vaguely might be, Percy put the periscope up and scanned the horizon. She saw some aircraft off in the distance, but they weren't coming towards the _Prospect._ Soon, Percy felt like they must be in the new Authority's waters. But there was really no way to tell.

They cruised easily with the sail up and the diesels running for the next few hours. Hemi repeatedly made the trek down through the _Prospect_ and into the _Gnat_ to check the remaining fuel. He didn't trust the _Gnat's_ fuel gauges, so each time he opened up the fuel tank and put in a dip stick and held it up to his flashlight by an oily rag to note the fuel level remaining. 

On one of these trips through the boat he found Chips asleep in her rack, and got her up to go tend the engines. "Tune 'em to within a inch of their life for efficient fuel consumption!" he told her. And she spent the rest of the trip to the depot deep in the ship, carefully and continually trimming the diesel engine's fuel intake.

No matter how parsimonious they were with the power usage and the fuel consumption though, the _Prospect_ was so much bigger that it was eating through the remaining fuel in the _Gnat_ at an insatiable rate. Back in the control room of the _Prospect_ Hemi calculated their fuel consumption rate by hand, and measured it against how far they had to go. He could not promise Percy that they would not be rowing the _Prospect_ the last few miles.


### They talk about why the sub with the ram is pursuing them

By this time Hemi, Shakes, and Percy were exhaustedly staring at the wall of gauges in front of them. Most of the gauges were completely unmoving as they were not varying speed, direction, or depth, and the fuel gauge simply read zero, since it didn't reflect the fuel they were sucking up from the _Gnat_. Other than Hemi's occasional forays down to the _Gnat_ to check the hard numbers, they were simply going on hope that they had enough fuel to make it to the depot and not get left stranded once again over empty, and deep, seas.

Hemi finally broke the bleary, smoke-filled silence. "Something bothers me Percy."

"We've been scraping our way on our bellies under the razor-wire fencing of hell's fucking perimeter for days now, and _now_ something bothers you Hem'?" Percy chuckled at him.

"I think that's exactly it, we've been so on edge and so burned out that I haven't had a chance to step back and consider things."

"Well, what is it that's eatin' ya big guy?"

"The sub with the ram. You said the one hunting for us in circles back there was the same that rammed us, right? You're sure about that?"

"Abso-fucking-certain. Lotta subs look the same through the scope, sure, but that ram is unique. Some kinda custom job, without the sleekness ya see on military machines usually. Looks like it was worked up as some ancient siege engine, for storming a stone fortress or something, and some crazy motherfucker bought it as scrap and welded the whole damn heavy water-dragging thing onto the front of their submarine."

Hemi nodded. "So if it's the same sub, which seems likely, it seems very _unlikely_ to me that they just happened on us twice. This is what's bothering me: do ya think they are specifically pursuing _us_?"

"I had the same thought." Said Shakes. "But I didn't want to put my fucking nose into your business, just as I wouldn't want you askin' about mine. But since yer asking Hemi..."

"It does seem odd. We're just a transport." Percy said, looking steadily at Shakes. "We're always being harassed by various Authorities in general-like ways. But who among them has the inclination to _pursue_ a transport sub? We're small potatoes by any measure you care to put to it. They have wars to fight and borders to defend up there. They spend their concentrated long-term resources on their never-ending fucking conflicts with each other. Harassing commerce too much is bad for, well, fucking business."

"And we are the commerce." Said Shakes.

"If that sub with the ram was pursuing us particularly," continued Percy, "seems most likely they won't follow us across Authority lines, and they'll lay off the pursuit at this point. We'll just avoid coming back this way any time soon."

"Leaves ya with a big fuckin' mystery as to _why_ though, don't ya think?" Asked Shakes.

"Indeed." Said Hemi. "Though sometimes the pragmatic course of action is to leave the questions aside, and move in a different direction."

"And the direction we're moving in right now is towards that depot, and away from the mystery of the sub with the ram." Said Percy.

The silence settled back in on them. Captain Percy lit up yet another cigarillo and filled up the small space of the control room with smoke. Hemi slid back down to the navigation chart with his flashlight, and a few minutes later called up to Percy. "Hey Capt, the island with the depot on it should be coming in sight with the periscope soon."


### They approach the depot island, are inspected

"About fuckin' time." Said Percy as she raised the periscope. The bearing was obviously straight ahead, so she swung the barrel of the periscope around while looking through the viewfinder. The cigarillo hung from her lips, with smoke rising up to her nostrils. "Ay. Fuckin' dawn's cracking up there... and I see a blot of an island ahead of us." She watched it for a while. It slowly, slowly came towards her and details came into view. It was a rocky, slightly cliffed shore with some sparse vegetation on top.

"Uh, Shakes," she said with a sinking somewhat terrified feeling, "there's nothing on that island."

"Naw!" Said Shakes. "Course not. The depot is for, uh, discreet operations. It's entirely underwater, built into the side of the seamount."

"Ah." Said Percy. It was totally normal to build part of a depot that handled sensitive cargo underwater to keep Authority eyes off comings and goings. But usually there was a small surface component too for handling completely licensed and permitted cargo, and for the convenience of being able to operate without the complexity and care required to work underwater fittings when it was possible to do so. But she could see how if a depot were located close to the border between two very aggressive Authorities, as this one was, it was clearly logical to keep the whole operation off the surface. On the other hand, it also meant these might be rougher and less agreeable characters than the typical scum they dealt with in the submarine transport industry.

"So, how do we..." Percy started to ask.

The ship-to-ship radio lit up over her head. _"To approaching submarine: stop your motors and prepare to be boarded."_

"That's how." Said Shakes.

They shut the _Prospect's_ motors down, and Percy climbed up and opened the top hatch of the sail. A mini-sub, maybe 15 meters long had surfaced off their starboard side, and a couple of large men, almost as big as Hemi, were climbing into an inflatable boat. They motored across the gap between the two subs, and climbed up the steel rungs on the outside of the _Prospect's_ sail.

"Transport sub?" Were the first words from their mouth. They wore old moth-eaten wool clothes: tightly worsted slacks, and cable-knit sweaters, like old North Atlantic fishermen.

"Ya." Said Percy. "We're unarmed: no tubes."

"Right." said the other of the two and spat on her deck. "We just gotta do a quick check if ya want to come any closer to the fuckin' island. Otherwise, ya gotta go back the way ya came."

"Well, we got no fuel left, so get your check over with."

They climbed down the hatch. They spent the next 20 minutes crawling through the _Prospect_ with Shakes and Hemi. When they got back to the control room, they were a little less gruff. "Eh, fuck. Sorry, but being fucking careful in these waters is how we stay in fucking business. Y'all seem harmless enough, though it's weird fucking coming in hauling another sub under ya. Get on the ship-to-ship and contact the docking control office. They'll give you a docking assignment, and turn the sonar beacon on for ya."

"Alrighty. Thanks." Said Percy.

They climbed off the sail without a word and headed back to their small patrol sub.

"Don't worry." Said Shakes. "Maybe not the friendliest people, but we should be able to get everything yer boat needs here."


### They dock at the underwater dock

Percy picked up the ship-to-ship mic and raised the docking control office, now within range of the ship-to-ship radio. They got their docking port and, sealing up the _Prospect_, they used the last remaining few minutes of their batteries to dive the boat. 

[//]: # (Not sure how much you want to get into visual description of exteriors in the next graf. Might be more interesting to only describe it from the inside.)
The docking bay was located about 20 meters down underwater. It was typical underwater docking bay for cargo --- a long cylindrical tube of curved and welded plate steel. It stuck 100 meters out of the side of the seamount and was supported by a hazardous and seemingly randomly placed array of bracing bars that ran from the tube back to the seamount at an angle. There were docking slips of a wide variety of sizes placed on all four sides of the tube along the entire length of it, capable of docking a wide variety of sizes and orientations of cargo subs. There were between a dozen and two dozen slips, and maybe half of them had submarines docked at them already, arranged at various angles, like leeches with orifices sucking at a giant limb.

The _Prospect_ followed the sonar beacon to docking slip four, which located on the bottom of the docking bay tube. It was the largest size slip this depot had available --- or even widely used in the transport sub industry. It was something of a standard size for large cargo hold hatches. They carefully eased the _Prospect_ up under slip four, it until the big cargo hatch on the deck came up under the docking slip and connected to it --- essentially a scaled-up maneuver of exactly how the _Gnat_ had mated to the underside of the _Prospect_.

Hemi went down to the cargo hold, and walked hunched-over out across the catwalk that hung a short way down from the ceiling to the cargo hatch. He picked up a rubber mallet that was left hanging on some hooks by the catwalk for this purpose and banged on the big cargo hatch with it, setting off a pleasant low gong sound. He waited a few second and then heard the pop of the dock crew unsealing the hatch into the docking bay above him, the whirr of an electric pump sucking the residual water out of the slip well, and then a few minutes later came the answering pounding on the _Prospect's_ cargo hatch letting Hemi know it was OK to pop it. He released the hatch locks.

Two winches were set on either side of the cargo hatch along the catwalk. The big hatch had two curved and concave doors that lay one over the other to form a low dome. The upper one needed to be raised first. Hemi grabbed the wheel that turned the winch and put a good portion of his straining and powerful muscle into it, but it wouldn't budge. This sometimes happened when the air pressure between a sub and a dock wasn't exactly equalized. Hemi was trying to push up the door when there was slightly more than an atmosphere of pressure weighing on it.

He picked up a breaker bar that hung next to the rubber mallet and set it over a fat pin of steel welded to the column of the winch wheel. With the extra meter or so of leverage, he easily turned the winch wheel a few degrees and there was an audible pop and hiss as the extra pressure of the air in the depot pushed through the slit in the cargo hatch and into the _Prospect_. Hemi pinched his nose and cleared his ears with a pop that sounded like a small version of the sound of the hatch opening.

Once the seal was broken he stowed the breaker bar and easily, but somewhat slowly, winched open one cargo hatch door and then the other. When the doors were fully opened, he extended a steel ladder --- its pawls clanking on the locking teeth --- up into the docking bay so a person could climb up and down from the _Prospect_.


### Description of the docking bay

Hemi climbed up the ladder and was greeted by two more men who Hemi would swear were clones of the men who came out to inspect the _Prospect_ before they docked. The same enormous bulk, the same worn wool clothes, the same gruff look.The two men lit up cigarettes and spat bits of stray black tobacco out on the deck while they waited for Hemi to come up the ladder.

These guys did give Hemi a rough handshake when he stepped off the ladder, but offered little more in the way of welcome. Hemi managed to get some monosylabic directions from them to the dock boss, and the impression that she would be able to set them up with repairs and refueling and other boat maintenance needs. Hemi thanked them, gave them a little money for their trouble, and with money in hand they quickly wandered off without any further pomp.

[//]: # (Have these guys demand a docking fee from Hemi.)

Hemi stepped a few steps back down the ladder until he was enough inside the _Prospect_ to use the intercom to raise Captain Percy. He gave her him impressions of the docking bay and told her they needed to talk to the dock boss.

"Stay there Hemi. I'll be up in a few minutes with Shakes." Percy responded over the intercom.

The two of them appeared a quarter of an hour later or so. Captain Percy was carrying a beaten and cracked leather folio in which she kept the ship's books. Shakes was empty-handed, but had apparently freshly greased and pointed his hair for the big outing on the depot dock.

Hemi had been waiting out on the deck of the docking bay. He gave them a hand up the ladder, and when they were all assembled they started off towards the far end of the docking bay where they saw a wooden sign painted white and with square hand-painted black letters said "Dock Office." Getting to the dock office was a matter of navigating around the big open holes in the deck which led down into the cargo bays of other docked subs, or the ladders hanging down from the subs above them, or stacks of crates waiting to be loaded into subs docked on either side. The places where no submarines were docked were typically used for storing cargo that was making its way down the docking bay in stages towards whatever sub they were destined to be loaded onto, or up the dock from where they had been unloaded. It made for slow progress, since they had to watch every step and stop to wait for workers who were in the process of moving cargo. The docking bay was bigger than any space on a submarine --- maybe 12 to 15 meters in circumference --- but still cramped and grimed. They felt right at home.


### The dock office and the dock boss

They made their way through the docking bay to the dock office. This was simply a partition made of cheap painted wood built in front of the disused space of of the first docking slips in the docking bay. It was brightly lit. Both sides were lined with metal chairs on which were stacked folders and binders of paper. The center of the office was mostly taken by a large steel desk with a rusted and chipped enameled surface. It too was covered with papers, loose, stacked, on clipboards, and in binders.

Behind the desk sat yet another huge person, also dressed in similar heavy wool garments that had been aerated in places by baby moths. Hemi would not have tried to guess, being the parsimonious fellow he was, but the men who had met him on the dock had referred to the dock boss as 'she.' She tipped back her cap when they entered the office, and held a clipboard out at arm's length in front of herself, trying to get a little better focus on what was written on it.

"You must be from the boat that just came in on slip four, eh?" She asked.

"That's right. I'm Captain Percy. She's my boat." The dock boss squinted up at her.

"Actually, there's two boats." Said Shakes.

"Ah, hmm." Said the dock boss. "There's a note here that you have a mini sub mated on the bottom of the big boat. That's a pretty unusual fucking docking arrangement."

"Wouldn't normally come in that way," said Hemi, "but we're in pretty bad shape. We had to rig up a whole complicated situation with the smaller sub to have enough power to get here. We've basically got no power, no fuel, and we need repairs, restock, and hopefully some new Employment."

"Hmph. Well. We're full-service here. We're pretty isolated, so we keep a lot of stock and parts on hand. Having a deep supply is the good side of being isolated. The bad side is that shit's going to be pretty expensive. It costs a premium to move it out here. I'll give folks honest assessments --- hell that's how I got this shitty, grinding position of dock boss --- but most of the goods around here are sold from the crew of one independent operator to another. I can't control what prices those connivers might try to get from those who might be a little desperate."

"Well, that's a reason why we're also looking for a job. We could use some inflow of cash. Are there any leads on cargo that needs hauling?" Asked Percy.

"Can't help you there. I'm the dock boss, I just handle the dock. Work is found further up the tunnel. There's a market and exchange floor up there. Because we're the only depot out this way, enough stuff moves through here that you should be able to wrangle up something that pays. Me, I'll give ya a list of contacts up and down the dock who should be able to set you up with fuel and repairs and the like. I'll try to give you the least-worst of that bunch of bone-scraping, marrow-sucking dickheads." She started scribbling down a list of names and associated slips on the back of a used enveloped.

"That's certainly our first priority." Said Hemi. "What about Authorities? Any activity from them around here much?"

"Mostly they leave us the fuck alone. As I say, this is one of the only places you can move goods for cash in this part of the ocean, so we end up being a small but critical operation. The Authorities on one side want their people to be able to trade goods, and the Authorities on the other side want that too --- even if they would never admit it, and would prefer to endlessly skirmish over where exactly the line lies. It's a good, quiet operation here, far from the fucking noise and crush of all the meaningless action and events that seem so important to those folks trying to carve up pieces of the surface for control. It's pleasantly remote here, it is. While it lasts anyway."

"Sounds like a nice place to retire." Said Shakes. "No sun, no wind, nothing to keep you from happily living out your days in a dark grimy hole."

"Anyway.." Percy interrupted, "thanks for the orientation. Hemi can you get that list of contacts for repairs and refueling? Shakes, you probably want to go with him and make sure the _Gnat_ gets fueled back up?"

Shakes nodded. 

With a list of contacts from the deck boss and a few more passing words of thanks, they cleared out. Hemi and Shakes went down the docking bay in the direction they had initially come from to start talking to vendors about refueling and repairs. Percy went the other way, up off the docking bay.


### Percy walks up the exchange floor: description

The welded steel plating of the docking bay tube extended 10 meters or so beyond the dock office which marked the close end of the docking bay, where it was set against the sea mount. Just beyond the dock office the tube angled upwards, and Percy had to walk up a steep ramp. Then the tube narrowed to five or six meters wide, and passed through a thick bulkhead with a large watertight door that could be closed by massive hydraulics. Most underwater docks had some kind of system like this. Small leaks on the docks could be repaired while pumps moved the water out. But if a something major happened, say a docked submarine ripped away leaving a giant hole in the dock, this door could be closed, divers would go in and make repairs, and they could then blow the water out of the dock with a high pressure system. Of course, that wouldn't save anyone trapped on the other side of the door when it closed, or keep any open cargo bays in docked subs from flooding. These underwater docks were in fact incredibly dangerous, and the stories of failures --- more of them than anyone would care to admit --- were the stuff of submariner's nightmares. The repressed fear of a dock failure was an odd sense for a seagoing person, since traditionally ports were associated with safety for ships.

A little further up the ramp from the watertight bulkhead, the steel plating ended where it was bolted and sealed into the raw rock of the seamount. The space widened here. This whole part of the depot was hollowed out of the underground stone and the walls were left as raw, cut rock. In places the lines of drill holes could still be seen where explosives had been placed to more quickly open spaces for the chamber during its consstruction. This was all pretty unusual and expensive. Most depots with an underwater dock kept the underground construction to a minimum and moved as much of the operation to the surface as was practical. Percy sensed that there must be some discreet Authority funding behind this place.

The upward slope also became far less dramatic, just a slight upward ramp. But the ramp was maintained for an obvious reason: few underground spaces were totally dry and this one was not an exception. The ramp slowly drained a fetid and oily moisture down the middle of the open space of the upper parts of the depot. And the water carried along with it the accumulated grime of a working floor of industrial and commercial projects: metal shavings, coffee grounds, oils and solvents, and random bits of floating garbage. It was all collected in a sluiceway covered by choked and rusting grating that was supposed to keep any of this stuff from running further down to the docking bay.

The wet grit ground under the hard soles of Captain Percy's boots as she made her way up the length of the merchant exchange floor, stepping around the places where oil or garbage had pooled on the uneven rock of the ground.

The main hall was lit by bright bars of harsh light overhead, which illuminated the center of the space fairly brightly. The center of the entire length of the hall was being used for the activities that required the most space: stacks of wooden crates containing cargo that was being actively exchanged, repairs on large metal machines that was in some places slung from cieling by heavy chain run through blocks, and the parked heavy equipment used to move all this tonnage up and down the space. 

The lighting did not do much to illuminate the deeper sides of the space. Back in those corners were shadows created by smaller stacks of crates, punctuated by the occasional table set up by a trader and lit by a lamp, and in some places with alcoves carved back into the rock for a more formal shop space.

There was a fairly loud wash of sound: the snap of arc welders liquefying bits of metal, traders negotiating the value of crates and where they would be moved from or to, and the clinking of chains rolling through blocks, straining to lift the mass of some metal object. There was also the inevitable and unintelligible shout of panic as some other massive metal object suddenly moved in a way it was not supposed.

Her nostrils were assaulted by the smells of sweat, tobacco smoke, oil, and sharp ozone.

About a third of the way up the hall, her eye was caught by one of the bigger shops cut back into the wall. It was better lit than most, and the proprietor had taken the time to crack open a number of the crates stack up in the shop and create an arrangement of some of the more attractive goods.


### In the hardware store; Percy meets Trinity

Percy turned into the shop. It sold hardware. A wide array of tools and parts were stacked up among the hay and batting used as packing material in the crates. Some of the packing material had inevitably escaped the crates and was being crushed into the grime on the floor. 

The larger items were stacked towards the front of the store, presumably because they were harder to steal, Percy realized. The crates at the front of the shop tended to be opened face-up, and she could look down into them to see large motors, piping, valves, and hundreds of other large elements that went into making a submarine work. 

As she moved towards the back of the shop, the crates tended to be laid on their side and opened. Many of the crates had dozens of hooks nailed into them and smaller tools and parts for sale hung from the hooks. The shopkeeper somehow both managed to both show very little interest in the few customers poking around in the crates, and yet never stop watching them.

Percy had a perennial list of hardware she needed for the _Prospect_. It was one of those lists that only ever seemed to grow, and rarely got things crossed off it. She almost immediately found a box with a wide variety of screw-tightened clamp sizes that was being sold as a single unit and looked incredibly useful. It was not on her hardware list, so she regretfully didn't get to cross anything off. On the other hand, these clamps would already be aboard the _Prospect_ when they needed them, rather than waiting to be purchased on the list at the next stop.

Percy picked up the box of clamps and moved to look at some of the larger parts. She looked down into an open crate and there was a beautiful pump motor. It was in factory-new condition a rarity these days when most machines --- even excellent ones --- had been rebuilt a dozen times over. It was the kind of motor used in dozens of places and applications on the _Prospect_. It too was not actually on her list of needed parts, but was potentially so useful that she couldn't imagine not buying it. In such a condition it was, however, not cheap.

She leaned over the crate and ran her fingers under the cover to check for hidden grit and make sure it was actually in as good condition as it looked, and not just well-cleaned. As she did so an old crone who had been looking at a box of steel piping near her leaned in her direction as well to admire the pump motor. "That's a fine-looking piece of machine." The lady said to Percy, her voice croaking softly so it took Captain Percy a second to interpret what the lady had said.

"I have a boat where I could use ten more of these." Percy replied.

"Pretty expensive element for buying multiples of." The lady offered. She was frail and small. In this depot full of huge people, she was certainly the tiniest Percy had seen, or would even expect to see. She had big rubbery ears and a heavily-lined face with a tiny nose that wiggled when she talked. She was dressed in a wool cloak that was worn but clearly originally of thick high-quality material. Over it, she wore a fraying shawl with an intricate fair-isle pattern. She looked like a person who would never be quite warm enough in this hole of rock they were currently in.

"The cost is the reason I'll be lucky to get a single one of these." Said Percy.

"Hrmmm.... what if I told you I could set you up with a little cash?"

Percy looked at the tiny stick-figure-in-a-sack skeptically. "Like a loan?" She asked.

"No no. I don't go in for usary. That's for the real criminals. I'm offering a job. But one that would pay exceptionally well."

"Well, that's certainly a unlikely coincidence that you happen to offer me work when I was about to go groveling for some up and down the hall out there..."

"You did mention you have a boat. This job requires a boat."

Percy nodded.

"But..." the old lady continued, "to be transparent, I did receive a note that you might be a good fit for this particular work. So you see, it's not exactly coincidence that I found you in here."

Percy put a couple of things together and realized the dock boss must have sent word to this lady. An awfully nice gesture --- if they weren't setting Percy up. She wondered what she had done to deserve a kind move from the dock boss. "Thanks for the transparency. I don't like the suggestion of a benign universe that coincidence suggests."

"Ah," said the lady, "yes, it's easier to believe the plot and the happenings are motivated by someone's will, eh? That it isn't all just random chaos, and the coin-toss sometimes comes up in your favor?"

"Oh I believe in the chaos," said Percy, "I just don't believe it comes up in my favor."

The lady grinned a wide gapped-tooth smile. "I think I can work with such a person. Would you be interested in coming back to my office and hearing the offer I have? It's... not really fit for public spaces."

Percy again put aside the suspicion that she was being set up. She needed the work. "Yes lets." Percy put down the box of clamps, and noticed that the shopkeeper watched her do so.


### Negotiation with Trinity for the mines job

"My name is Trinity." croaked the old lady as she hobbled along next to Percy.

Percy took her arm to help her along. It was a thin little stick of bone in Percy's strong hand. "That's an interesting name." 

"I had a very devout upbringing. Your name is Percy, right?"

"Sylvia Percy, ya. So you know all about me already?

"In my line of work, it is best to know a little something about those you hire. Though again, in the interest of transparency, all I really know is your name and that you have a boat."

"What's with all the transparency?" Percy asked.

"Ah yes. Typically I play my cards somewhat closer. But this job is of some urgency, so I am hoping to build some trust with you quickly. I can only hope you respond reciprocally. 

"Well then, in the interest of transparency you should know that my boat, as solid as she is, is currently in desperate need of some downtime for repairs. I'm not sure how much urgency we can put into picking up a job."

"With the amount I'll be offering you, I think you will be able to make the shortest possible downtime a priority."

Percy didn't respond to that. This seemed too good to be true. This old lady was either senile, lying, or there was a catch yet to be revealed.

"Here we are." Said Trinity, steering Percy towards a low creosoted wooden door set into the wall. The inside of Trinity's office had the same bare rock walls as all the other spaces, but was more warmly lit from sconces. There were wooden file cabinets along the walls. The center of the space had a few large heavily-stuffed leather chairs and a small table between them.

"I can offer you tea or coffee, Captain Percy."

"Coffee please. A good amount of sugar."

"Cream?"

"Holy fuck --- pardon my language --- you have cream? Real, liquid cream?"

"It's extremely expensive but, as with most things, it can be had here for the right price. I am happy to share a few drops with a business prospect."

"By all means then."

Captain Percy sat in one of the leather chairs and accepted a ceramic cup with mud-colored contents with one hand. With the other hand she took a metal clipboard with chipping black paint and oil-stained pages that Trinity was holding out to her.  She scanned it while taking her first sip of coffee. It was the best coffee Percy had had in months. 

Trinity lowered herself groaning into the chair opposite Percy.

"So you want us to ship magnetic mines?" Percy asked.

"Please," said Trinity, "this shipping of mines is extremely restricted and mostly illegal. These are magnetically-activated industrial explosives."

"...For which the primary use would be mines, and thus still illegal to ship."

"The units are absolutely agnostic about how they are used. Doesn't have to be a mine: could be a torpedo, missile, suicide-bomber, sling-shot, whatever. The oceans teem with rusting hulks of ferrous metal, grinding their way back and forth, and under, the surface of the sea, leaving their foul trails of oil, carbon, and noise. There is quite a bit of demand for units that can help clean up the mess."

"Is that why you need us? You can't get an Authority seal to ship these because they are going to a group that's trying to 'clean' up the oceans?"

"You know as well as I do that the seal of one Authority just aggravates the aggression of another, regardless of where, or whom, they are going to." She sighed. "Unfortunately these days conventional shipping ends up being an unwinnable game of tic-tac-toe with a high chance that no matter how well stamped, sealed, and authorized a shipment like this might be, it will simply never arrive at its destination due to, shall we say, interference from another protagonist. The most reliable way is to use a specialty shipping services unit like yours, with your professional expertise at clandestine maneuvering and your discreet interests. It's simply a matter of reliability, you know. Nothing more."

"Certainly if we were any less reliable, I wouldn't be standing here talking to you right now."

"There's also the matter of speed. I really need to get these units out of this depot in the next couple of days. I'd rather not say why, so do not ask. But I do believe it will benefit us both if you do as I suggested earlier and make the repairs to your boat as quickly as possible and move on with this cargo."

"Well, that brings us to the price. To make the repairs a priority is not going to be cheap, especially from what I hear about the workers available on the dock."

"Captain Percy, in this particular case money is a secondary consideration. Name your price."

Percy hesitated. "How about... three times a standard hull-load fee?"

"Done. I can pay you two-thirds now and the remainder on delivery. I assume coin will be satisfactory?"

"Absolutely." Said Percy, kicking herself that she didn't ask for more. Still she have never been paid triple for a hull load before.

Trinity stood and shuffled over to a sideboard where an enormous ledger book was laid out open. She made marks with a large fountain pen in it between counting out heavy coins and placing them into a soft leather satchel. While counting she continued the conversation as if it were no effort. "This must be quite a bit of money for you Captain Percy. Tell me, have you thought about selling your boat after you make the delivery and taking all the profit you would have and settling down with a nice man somewhere?"

Percy smiled at the matronly side that had suddenly come out of Trinity. "Well, you know what the old cliche says about captains: I'm married to my boat. There's no man who could compete with her. Besides, you know how the surface life is: where it isn't chaos it's bureaucracy. I'd rather stay underwater."

Trinity nodded. "Unfortunately there's some truth to that. There's no sure future anywhere on the surface. Makes it hard to commit to settling down anywhere particular."

"Not to change the subject Trinity, but how likely is it that we're going to have some kind of Authority interference while trying to move this shipment of yours?"

"You know how the Authorities are Captain Percy. In some places they pursue everything. An honest shipper cannot _ever_ promise they won't interfere. That's why we move things by submarine: interference is a lot less likely if they don't know the shipping is happening. In this case, I would suggest that you do you absolute best to make sure no Authority finds out this particular shipment is happening."

Percy looked into her nearly-empty coffee cup, and then savored the last sip of its creamy sweetness. "Well, I guess you get what you're paid for." She stood. "Thanks for the coffee with cream." 

"You are most welcome. I'll have my men down on the dock by the end of today with the cargo, if you think you could be ready to load your boat by then."

"Thanks." She turned to go.

"Captain Percy, If I were you I would definitely make sure you are gone from here before the next 48 hours goes by."

Percy nodded towards her and closed the heavy door behind her as she left the office.


### To the bar; hiring Cassandra

Captain Percy hummed to herself as she left Trinity's office and walked through the main hall of the noisy depot. She realized that her humming was resonating in her skull with the ever-present background hum of the machinery that kept the place functioning. She followed the trickle of oily water down the slope a little ways until she noticed a kind of canteen or saloon carved back into one of the walls. She walked in and stepped up to a bar at nearly the height of her chest. It was broad and made of dark wood from which decades of drinkers had worn away the original shellac coating. A universe of spilled drinks had stained to a mottled gray color. As in all the remote places of the world, the bar was well stocked. Rows and rows of partially empty bottles of brown liquors were lined up behind it.

The man behind the bar was yet another giant, though more fat than stocky like the others Percy had seen. He was grizzled about the face, like a piece of meat that hadn't been cleaned properly before being laid down in the frying pan. He was missing an eye which he didn't bother to cover with a patch, and wearing a stained leather apron. "What cha need there lady?" He asked Percy.

"Give me a house drink." She put one of her heavy new coins down on the wood of the bar. 

As the bartender set up a glass and was leaning to pour it she continued. "Actually, I'm looking to hire some crew. I have a boat, and we're short a few people. Thought you might be able to steer me in the right direction to where the hiring is done around here."

"Most of the steering I do it towards the bottles." Said the bartender. "You want crew you're better off down on the dock. Usually there's some greenies hanging around, going boat to boat and asking for work even. Useless fuckers, skills wise, but always seemingly around." He thought for a few seconds while he finished off the pour. "On the second hand, a lot of big boats have come through in the last week or so. It's possible they've hired up all the greenies. _Big_ fuckin' boats. 200 meters and more."

"Yeah, that kind of boat is always hiring. Shit, that doesn't sound good. I'm a little desperate."

The bartender squinted up his face where his eye would have been considering for a few seconds. "Hrmm. Well, if yer fuckin' desperate... Bartendin' is my side-gig. My main business, and much more profitable I might add, is pimpin'."

"You don't say." Said Percy into her drink. 

He pretended not to hear her. "Think about pimpin' in a place like this is sometimes you gotta take risks on the folks ya bring over from the mainland to work. Beggers can't be choosers, ya might say. So sometimes I end up with whores I can't pimp out. Or at least not at a price that makes them worth the food they eat."

"Always difficult to balance those books, I hear ya man." Said Percy.

"Anyway, right now I got me this waif that got off a boat a few weeks ago. But she's skinny and small. Waif-life, I say, you know what I mean?"

Percy nodded.

"The tastes of most of the folks who come through here are into something a bit... harder. And also whiter. You know what the inability to market an off-color whore tells me about this place? 

"What?"

"It tells me there's a bunch of racist fuckers in these water's that's what."

"And here we are thinking we're a modern people."

"A modern people! That's fuckin' right."

"What else can you tell me about the promising prospect?"

"Well, that's the other thing: she's got the just the saddest fuckin' face. And she's too shy. Even I can't bring meself comfortable like for pimping her out. A pimp has got to have a heady you know."

"So you're saying I could hire her off you because she makes you too sad?"

The bartender shrugged. "Plus a finders-fee like." He said, eyeing her clinking leather satchel.

"Thing is, I need a sonar operator. Do you think this waif has good ears?"

He shrugged again. "I wouldn't know. She listens to a lot of fuckin' music. Does that mean anything?"

"Might mean she's already fuckin' deaf." Said Percy. She sipped her drink. "Fuck it. I'm not going into battle, if she's not completely deaf, we can have her sit sonar watch during long runs. She won't be completely useless."

"Swell." Said the bartender. "I need that little shadow out of my life." He called down the bar to where a small group of skinny girls and a couple of boys were milling about aimlessly. "Cassandra! Come over here. I have someone I want you to meet."

A tiny girl with stick arms and huge brown eyes under tight curls of black hair walked towards them. She was wearing a thin and short slip of a dress made of cheap cotton.

As she got nearer the bartender said flatly, "This lady might want to hire you." And turned away to deal with some other customers.

"Jesus." Said Percy. "Can you see in the dark with those eyes girl?"

"I wish." Said Cassandra quietly, looking down.

"Look, I'm not trying to fuck you here. I've got a boat, and I'm leaving in less that 48 hours and need to crew up. Your friendly bartender-pimp you might be willing to work on a boat instead of whatever it is you do now. You ever work on a boat before? Or anything technical? Maybe, god-willing, sonar or something sonics related?"

"God no. I'm a whore. Or, supposed to be. Apparently I'm not very good at that."

"On a boat nobody cares how good you are at fucking. All I need is someone who is good at being alone for long periods of time and listening to mind-numbing ambient noise on the sonar for hours on end without going insane. Think you could do that?" Percy looked at the skinny young girl skeptically, though in the back of her mind she rememebered that her start on submarines had not been very much different than this.

Cassandra nodded without saying anything.

"Good."

"But... isn't working on submarines dangerous?" Cassandra wondered. "In general I'd rather live in this hole than die in a hole in the sea."

"It's incredibly fucking dangerous. I won't lie to you about that. But we're compensated for the danger, it pays very well, enough for us to live by our own terms. Enough to buy you out of your current job. There's also the fact that there's a limited number of people willing to go out there and carry out their lives while being all-around surrounded by dangers and fears that would liquify the guts of most folk. Submariners are an elite class, in their own filthy way."

"Why would anyone want wealth and freedom if they are dead though?"

"Look, there's dangerous and there's really fucking dangerous. You'd be mostly working sonar, at least at first. That's about as dangerous as tuning your stereo. You wouldn't have to work down in the engine room or throw lines or anything like that. Heck you couldn't lift a line even if I needed you to. You'd be facing the same base-level danger we all face on a submarine. If we face a situation where you might die, we'll all be facing that situation together. My boat has been running for decades without taking the whole crew down, and I expect she'll run for a couple more decades. That means you aren't going to die any time soon on this boat. Can you live with that?"

Cassandra nodded slowly.

"Now I'm only giving you this little motivational speech about the glories of being a submariner once. If you take the job it's on you to make it a part of yourself, and keep your fear bottled and your mind clear when you are working. Understand? Running a boat is a lot of work and more than anything else I need a crew that can motivate their own god-forsaken souls to do their jobs. It is not war, it is commerce."

Cassandra looked around at the dingy canteen and then directly at Percy for the first time. "OK, I'll do it."

"Fine. Get your things together and come down to slip four this evening ready to leave this place behind you. At the slip ask for Hemi. He'll get you settled and explain how the pay rates work for a greenie new crew member.  We'll train you on board after we're underway in a couple of days. For now, just stay out of the way and keep your mouth shut until someone specifically asks you to do something. Make sure you're always nearby to help the crew, but don't volunteer for anything since you don't know how to do anything. The crew know how to ask for your help when they can use it, and they don't want your help doing things you might fuck up." 

"I understand."

Percy put a heavy hand on Cassandra's shoulder and then turned away from the bar.

"Ahem!" The bartender fake-cleared his throat as he turned towards them and looked at Captain Percy with one eye and one socket. He rubbed his forefinger and thumb together in the air in front of him. 

"Right." She pulled a stack of coins out of the leather satchel, counted out more than a fair amount and stood them on the bar. She looked at Cassandra. "That was your first paycheck. Sorry it had to go to that guy, but it'll be the last one that does."

The bartender put a knuckle to his gristly eyebrow in a mock salute as they turned away again.

"Here," said Percy handing Cassandra a few coins, "that's an advance on your next paycheck. Buy some tougher clothes.


### Percy meal with Shakes --- hiring him long term.

Captain Percy left Cassandra in the middle of the hall. Cassandra went up the ramp towards the stairs to the next level up where the barracks were located. Percy turned down the ramp feeling like it was probably time to get back to her boat and see how things were going. She was warm from the liquor and had a bit of a sweat breaking in the still and humid underground air.

Walking down the ramp in the direction of the docks she saw the now-familiar clanking gate of Shakes climbing up the ramp. The collection of wrenches at his belt made him always walk like he had a limp. He put his hand up when his eye caught Percy coming towards him. "Captain! I was just coming looking for you. I wanted to talk to you about settling up and getting my boat off your tub."

"Yeah, it's about that time, eh Shakes? Let me buy you that meal I promised you first."

"Not going to say no to some grub."

They walked a short way back up the ramp of the exchange floor. Across from the saloon, set back in the opposite wall of the exchange floor was a small eatery. It glowed with orangish-red light that contrasted with the cold blue light of the hall.

Inside they got in line behind some other patrons dressed in dingy shades of wool. "Chicken or creamed spinach?" asked the short man with a large gravitational mass behind the row of steaming trays of food while tapping a long stamped-steel serving spoon against the tray.

They got some of each, a mounded plate full of steaming long-grained rice with bits of clove and chopped peas and cardamom scattered in it. The plates were stacked on steel trays splotched with rust, and a couple of piece of large crispy flat bread were piled on. Percy handed the tall man at the end of the counter a couple of coins from her satchel and they sat down at a chipped formica table amid the hum of basso-voiced dock worker conversations.

Shakes ripped off a piece of the bread and passed it to his other hand while he blew on the tips of his fingers. He passed the bread back to the first hand and then piled a good of white rice and green spinach onto it before leaning in and shoving half the wad into his gaping mouth.

While he was chewing, Percy brought him up to speed. "So I've fallen ass-backwards into a job Shakes."

He grunted acknowledgement and nodded, too busy eating to look up.

"It pays well.... really well."

That got Shakes to look up at her, but not to stop eating.

"Thing is, it's kinda risky. Might attract some attention from one Authority or another."

"Mmmph," said Shakes through his mouthful of bread, "that's usually how it goes.I assumed a job in that class is why that sub rammed you."

"Actually, I still don't know why they rammed us. As you know, the hold was empty at the time, we were doing a dry run. And we haven't been mixed up in anything for a while..." She drifted off a bit pondering that mystery that had been at the back of her mind while she ate her way along a bone of dry chicken.

"Anyway, this next job is going to require being a little more tactical, I think. A little more forethought and planning than the usual just trying to sneak under the radar and not be noticed."

"I'm not much for tactics myself. I have just the one: stay small, stay low in the water, don't get seen. It's simple and it works. Not much to think about, and I like it that way."

Percy nodded. "Something like that has always been my strategy too. But for this next job, I think I might need to add a somewhat more complex element." She shoveled a little rice into her mouth. "Remember part of our deal was that if I knew of any work I could connect you with I would?"

"Sure. You got something already?"

"Here's what I'm thinking: I'm hauling this risky load --- I won't get into details about it right now, just keep in mind that there's certain to be some Authorities who would be interested in checking the manifest. Now, I will of course, deploy the usual tactics of keeping my boat on the down low, running quiet, staying submerged during the day and only running on the surface at nice, and so on and whatnot. But I thought: what if in addition to keeping the _Prospect_ stealthy, we also had a partner with another craft of some type. And their job was to be _un_stealthy. To run as a decoy around and above the _Prospect_. Draw the curious eye, or ear, away, so to speak. And they would be clean of course. Any Authority inspection would turn up an empty hold or a dull cargo of stamped cigars or something."

"Interesting. You want to buy some kind of surface transport or pleasure craft then?"

"Naw. Surface craft are useless. The authorities know how to split their monitoring for a surface vessel and a submerged one. It has to be something that could be mistaken on sonar for the _Prospect_. Possibly a boat like the _Gnat_."

Shakes swallowed. "Interesting. So you want me to juice up the _Gnat_ so it sounds like it could be a big ol' fuckin' transport sub, and then you want to hire me to run around and get caught and inspected by various Authorities that might be hunting for the _Prospect_?"

"Or maybe _not_ get caught... you said the _Gnat_ was fast, right? You could outrun them when they started pursuing you... and at the same time lead them away from the _Prospect_."

Shakes started chewing again while he thought. "There is something appealing about the idea of being loud, fast, and brash after all these years of trying to sneak around and stay quiet. I can't say I have much experience at that kind of thing though."

"I have a feeling you'd be a natural at it." Said Percy.

"It would require a little work on the _Gnat_. I'd have to undo some of the dampening I've put in over the years. Need to tune it up for speed." 

Percy dropped the heavy satchel full of coins on the table in front of Shakes. Though when a couple of other patrons turned around too look for the source of that sound she realized it was kind of a dumb move. "Not to be dramatic, but this is only two-thirds of the payment for this job."

Shakes eyes widened. But he poked it with the handle end of his fork. "Better put that away. But what are you offering me exactly?"

"How about two deck-crew share's worth? And a deck-crew share on this run should be pretty lucrative."

Shakes nodded slowly, while chewing through another piece of bread. "Alright. Alright! But I want a stipend on top of that to cover the costs of any modifications to the _Gnat_. And enough to reverse them after we complete this run."

"Done." Said Percy.

Shakes grinned through a mouthful of food. "Well --- partner --- who knew picking up a bunch of fucking dirty marooned scumbags in the middle of the ocean would lead to anything profitable! Sweet."

"Well if that's settled, I've been away from my boat for a couple of hours now, and that is enough for some damage to have been done. I feel like I need to be getting back there."

"You go Captain Percy. I'm going to finish loading up on this chow."


### Back at the Prospect in the docking slip; talking to Hemi about re-hiring Chips

At docking slip four, the hole in the deck that led down to the cargo hold of the _Prospect_ was like a giant black maw, whose lips were pursed and sucked against the airlock dock of the depot. It now had a number of heavy black cables and hoses arcing into it, making it look a little like some kind of enormous dental maneuver was being worked on it. Captain Percy's eye scanned from where the hoses and wires were attached to pipes and terminals mounted on the walls of the docking bay, over the edge of the hole. She leaned over and looked down into the cargo hold where the cables and hoses were lashed together and ran in a hulking pile up the middle of the cargo hold back into the deeper parts of the ship where they were hopefully connected to the battery terminals and fuel tanks that so desperately needed to be topped up. At the front of the cargo hold, Chips was overseeing a repair crew from the dock that was working on redoing and reinforcing the desperate and messy repair welds Chips had made earlier.

She climbed down the ladder to the catwalk and made her way over and down to the deck of the cargo hold. From there she went aft into the forward battery room where she found Hemi with a dock worker trying to get cables hooked up to the battery bank so they could recharge the batteries from the docking bay power system.

"Hemi!" Percy yelled at him. "What is that woman still doing on this boat?" She said pointing forward to where Chips was standing. "Didn't I say she was to get off as soon as we hit the dock?"

"Come here," Hemi said calmly, leading her further back into the battery room. "I convinced her to stay long enough to oversee the repairs. She didn't want to be blamed if those guys did a lousy job and the seam burst open again later. So she's just making sure they fix it right."

"Fuck Hemi! When I fire someone, they stay fucking fired!"

"Captain, we need her. I cannot do all these jobs myself. I'm a middling welder at best. And I can't tell the difference in someone else's work between a good weld and a pile of dog waste."

"Owen can take over the welding."

"He's a kid! He can't tell these dock trolls what do to, even if he does know any better than them."

Percy considered. "OK... she oversees the repairs, we pay her up to date, and _then_ she's gone."

"Percy," He said looking directly at her, "we need her. You need to apologize and re-hire her. We can't leave this depot with no engineer and no welder aboard. And in case you hadn't noticed, there's not exactly a surfeit of talented crew waiting to be hired around here."

"Fuck." She kicked the battery shelving with her boot. "Fuck! You're right. You're always right and I fucking hate it when you're right. I'll go see if I can re-hire that little fucknut."

"Do it humanely. We need her to actually _want_ to stay and work."

"Speaking of work, the other reason we need to re-hire her is I fell into a plum job for use up on there on the exchange floor. For the moment, we're flush."

"Yeah?" Said Hemi skeptically, knowing that a transport job that paid well was unlikely to be easy or safe.

"Yeah. We've also got some free advice to be out of here in 48 hours." She handed him the leather satchel full of coins. "Here's the money. You know how this goes. Spend what you have to to get us out of here quickly."

"It's going to be tricky in this place to throw money around without also getting a bunch of useless hangers-on."

"But you're the best Deck Boss there is for people management Hemi. I'm sure you can walk that line between getting it done and not getting completely bilked. I should also let you know I hired a new kid to work sonar."

"I'm amazed. Seems like there's an unusual lack of greenies on the docks. Does she have any experience?"

"Not a bit. But who trains people better than you Hemi? She should be by later, if she doesn't skip out from fear." Percy gave him a light punch in the arm as she turned towards the cargo hold. "We can talk details over dinner later. Just keep things moving for the next few hours." She was already moving forward through the battery room into the cargo hold.


### re-hiring Chips

Percy made her way forward through the cargo hold and stood next to Chips, who was standing with her arms crossed watching a crew of over-sized dock workers sloshing around in the bilge water in tall rubber boots. A couple of them were bent over the now repeatedly stitched and patched gash that ran from the bottom of the boat up the curve of the side of the pressure hull.

"I'm collecting my pay and leaving as soon as I see that these fuckheads do a job that will hold. You're not pinning any fucking further leaks on me." Chips said to Percy.

"Yeah. Hemi said you would do that. Thanks. How bad is it?"

"When we was on the surface I had it patched up pretty fucking OK despite half the welds still being under the bilge water. But now the fuckin' boat's under ten or 20 meters of water, and the pressure is causing it to seep, like a fucking wet, oozing wound."

They watched the dock workers go at it for a couple of minutes. Then Percy said quietly to Chips, "Umm, it kinda looks like they're making it worse in places. Kinda fucking up some of your work."

Chips cracked her knuckles and breathed heavily through her nostrils. "Fucking useless fuckin' shit clods." She said under her breath. "Hey you fuckers, don't just fucking re-weld the failing fucking patches. Take them out and put _new_ fucking plate steel in, fucking damn it!"

There was an incoherent grumbling from the men standing in the puddle.

"Chips," Percy hesitated, "look, I need an engineer. And I need a welder. You're both of those things and I can't get either of them on this forgotten rock. I need you... at the very least for the next run. Maybe you could stay on until we hit a major port, and then you can find new work there..."

"What the fuck makes you so arrogant to fucking think I would go back out with a damn stubborn fucking ass-reamer like you?" Her face was flushing. "God fucking damn it. You'll fucking get me killed with your damn fucking stupidity, and is if that wasn't fucking bad enough, you would tell the story that it was my fucking fault somehow. You damn fucking twat."

"Fuck Chips! Look at the work these fucking meatheads are doing --- if we don't have you aboard, we're going to fucking go down when it fails and we have nobody on board who can fix it! Now, I've got a new job coming in, it pays really fucking good. I can offer you a fucking _double_ engineer's share for this next run. I'll even pay you half right fucking now." Percy said, reaching for her satchel full of coins.

"Ah fuck you Percy. You can hold the fucking money. You're a fucking shithead, but an honest fucking one and always fucking paid smartly." Chips pushed at the bilge water edge with the toe of her rubber boot. "Ah fuck. Look at this fucking work they're fucking doing. Y'all going to fucking die without me on board. You, Percy, I don't give two shits. But I couldn't live with fucking Hemi or Owen going down when I could have stopped it."

"Well, me neither Chips."

"OK you fucking cunt. You got me. I'm in for the next run --- double fucking engineer share. Now get the fuck away from me before I start looking for another piece of pipe. Actually I might need one for these fucker in the puddle anyway." She said looking around.

Percy walked away thinking she would do her best to just stay out of Chips' way on this run --- as much as one could stay out of anyone's way on a sub. But it was also reassuring to know she would be aboard.


### disconnecting the Gnat

At the other end of the cargo hold Captain Percy found Shakes had made his way back from the cafe and was having a conversation with Hemi through the hatch into the forward battery compartment. He stepped a little to the side as she came up so she could join in.

"Captain Percy. Hemi and I are talking about disconnecting my boat from the _Prospect_ at this point."

"You got the _Gnat_ refueled already?" Percy was a little surprised they had been able to move that quickly.

"Naw." Said Shakes. "But if you look back toward the end of the battery compartment, to the hatch down to the _Gnat_, you can see we've still got the _Gnat's_ batteries connected up to the circuit. That means since we've been charging the _Prospect's_ batteries," he nodded toward the heavy cables hanging from the _Prospect's_ cargo hatch and running up the middle of the cargo hold, "we've been feeding the _Gnat_ juice too. Hemi here figures there's enough charge on now that I could move the _Gnat_ to its own slip, and refuel there. ...Sending the bill to y'all of course."

Hemi nodded.

"And bonus," Shakes continued, "with that fancy fucking mating collar y'all added to the _Gnat_, I can dock in a regular slip for small boats instead of using one of those ridiculous universal docking tubes that they charge extra dock fees for."

Percy looked at Hemi. "Do we have more use for the _Gnat_ now Hemi?"

"As a spare battery bank? No. In fact keeping it connected it just slowing down our own charging process."

"Alright then." Said Percy. "Get that leech off my boat."

Shakes grinned. "Applying that leech _saved_ your boat."

Percy grinned and patted him on the arm.

"Hemi," said Shakes, "don't forget to return those manuals.

It didn't take too long for Hemi to seal Shakes into the _Gnat_ with his engine manuals and get it disconnected from the _Prospect_. Though Hemi wanted some help coiling and stowing the heavy jumper wires they no longer needed and it took a while to find one of the deck crew to help him.

Shakes steered the _Gnat_ further down the docking bay, and got it mated up to slip fifteen. After popping the _Gnat's_ hatch at that slip, he started the process of negotiating with the dock workers for finishing the job of getting the batteries charged up, and refueling the fuel ballast tanks. Pretty soon, the _Gnat_ was gorging on its own set of umbilicals running down through its sail hatch and into its belly.


### Hemi and Percy have dinner

Refueling, recharging, and repairs were busily carried out over the next six hours or so. There were many people coming and going and crawling around in her boat. That made Captain Percy uncomfortable --- almost all of the time she knew exactly who was aboard her submarine. In dock like this was the only time there was open access to her boat. Just another reason to be on the move, as far as she was concerned.

All of the activity meant that Hemi was probably spending heavily to get things done quickly. Considering the condition they came in, in normal circumstances they would plan on staying on the dock for a week or two. Hell, with the damage to the hull the _Prospect_ should really go into dry dock for serious repairs --- but that required a monetary flushness that was far beyond a single good-paying job. 

Getting the boat ready to go out again so quickly was not just expensive, it also meant cutting some corners that Percy wasn't happy about. The repairs to the hull continued to be a foul mess of patches and half-competent welds. Through Chips' streaming curses from the bow Percy got the impression that Chips felt she had done a better job welding underwater while the boat was moving than this whole team of ruddy thick-fingered men were doing with the boat dry and steady.

The only fuel Hemi could contract for on the dock on such short notice was a gritty and sludgy bunker. Chips was also not going to be happy about feeding that stuff to her engine when she found out about that.

By dinner time most of the critical repair and refueling work was wrapping up. Most of the crew took off for the cafe on the exchange floor to find some grub. Hemi and Percy stayed behind and ate in the _Prospect's_ galley, though they prepped dinner from fresher food items they had bought off the dock that included a cabbage head and a bit of gristly meat.

"What's left Hemi?"

"We still have to charge the high and low pressure tank systems. It would be better to do that from the dock rather than from diesels while we're moving, if we can."

Percy nodded.

"And we should take on some more food, refill the fresh-water tanks, and lay in a normal spread of spare parts..."

"Yeah, I tried to start buying parts earlier today but got sidetracked by the job offer. Put Gregory on securing our food stocks."

Hemi nodded and jotted a note on a scrap of paper clipped to a clipboard that lay next to his plate. "You're sure about this job Percy?"

"You saw the money! And that's only two-thirds of it."

"I don't trust jobs that pay _too_ well. What's the cargo?"

"Weapons parts --- magnetic mines."

"Had to be something like that didn't it? You don't have a problem with Authorities breathing down our necks and risking blowing the boat in half if someone drops a crate full of explosives?"

"Nitro Express Hemi. _Someone_ has to move this stuff. Might as well be pros like us. Cargo is supposed to arrive for loading any minute now, actually. Is the cargo hold ready for it?"

"Chips finished up repairs an hour or two ago --- at least as good as they could be for now --- and the bilge is pumped dry. I think we can start loading cargo. Though if we're hauling explosives you might want to pack in some soft padding first."

"I'm sure they have been thoroughly packed and duly deactivated... though it would be good if you took a peak at them before they get loaded so you're sure they _won't_ go off if someone walks by a crate with a heavy socket wrench or something."

There was a tap of someone's bony knuckles on the hatch to the galley, and Bastian swung it open a bit. He downed the last of an ice cream sandwich he had been working on and tossed the wrapper in the sink. "Back from dinner Cap. Bunch more of those big trolls up at the slip with crates they say are to be loaded into the _Prospect_.

"Thanks Bastian." Said Percy. "That is indeed our load. Come help us get these things stowed properly. Hemi?"

Hemi forked his last bite of meat, and squeezed his bulk out of the tight galley seating.


### Loading the magnetic mines

They climbed up the ladder from the catwalk to the docking bay to find dozens of large and molding wooden crates stacked up around the open hatch into the _Prospect's_ cargo hold. The sides of the crates were stamped with "XL industries" and "CAUTION!" Apparently XL Industries knew better than to put the word "EXPLOSIVES" on their packing materials --- which would attract unnecessary attention during any Authority inspection. But XL industries still felt that anyone handling their products should have a heads up that they shouldn't just be tossed around casually.

Making their way among the crates were a half dozen or so dock workers --- more huge swarthy men wearing moth-eaten tweed and leather suits and chomping on various forms of tobacco or seeds. They swarmed around a large push cart stacked high with the wooden "Caution" crates, and swinging crates off it from chains connected to a sliding block hanging from anchor points welded to the roof of the cargo bay tube. This sliding block would be used to lower the crates down into the cargo hold of the _Prospect_. A couple of men climbed down the ladder into the _Prospect_ to make their way down to the floor of the cargo hold to receive the lowered crates.

A dock worker wearing a worn bowler hat who was among the smallest Percy had seen since they docked --- his eyes were almost even with hers with round-framed glasses around them --- came up to her.

"You're Captain Percy, right?" He asked.

She nodded.

"This shipment is from Trinity. Sign here." He held out a pen and handed her a clipboard he was carrying that had a long sheet of tiny type printed on it with a signature blank at the end.

Percy took the pen and scrawled her illegible name into the blank.

"This document should have a witness too. Can he witness?" The dock worker asked, motioning his head towards Hemi.

"Yeah, Hemi put your scrawl on that thing."

Hemi adjusted his thin-framed glasses and more studiously scanned over the contract before he signed the witness blank. The man tore off a carbon copy and held it out to Percy. Hemi took it and folded it and put in in his jacket pocket.

By the time this was done the dock crew already had the first crate in a sling and suspended out over the _Prospect's_ cargo hold. The chain passed through a series of heavy iron blocks to a fat winch mounted to the wall of the docking bay. One of the big fellows was at the winch. "OK, I'm letting out some of the tension on the winch now!" He yelled over to his mates at the cargo hold entrance. They relayed the upsdate down to the men on the floor of the cargo hold.

"Bastian," Percy said, "go down to the cargo hold and make sure those goons are stowing things in a way that won't leave the boat untrimmable."

"Ay Cap." Bastian disappeared down the ladder into the cargo hold.

With much relayed yelling, the men got the first crate lowered down into the hold, then cranked the chains back up, slung the second crate, and repeated the process. Soon they had a clanking and yelling rhythm going and the hold of the _Prospect_ steadily filled with crates. Hemi and Percy watched, looking down through the hatch into the hold. As the dock workers moved the crates into the cargo bay of the sub, they arranged them like puzzle pieces, and then lashed them with inch-thick hemp rope to fixed loops welded to the walls of the submarine.

Bastian was doing a reasonable job of making sure the crates were being stacked, stowed, and lashed down in such a way that the boat wasn't likely to dive bow-first into the globergerina ooze as soon as they separated it from the docking bay. But Percy and Hemi knew it didn't matter how good a job Bastian did, they would have to make some adjustments to the balance of the load later to get the boat trimmed in the most efficient way possible. The key job for Bastian was simply to make sure the crates were organized in a way that making those adjustment later while they were under way wouldn't be too difficult.


### Cassandra arrives at the Prospect

In the middle of the loading Cassandra approached, a large canvas rucksack slung on the thin frame of her body, and holding large overly-stuff canvas satchels in each hand. She had apparently taken Percy's advice, and now wore thick duck pants and a button down shirt made of thick cotton, though the clothes hung loosely on her. Percy was happy to see she had also procured some thick rubber-soled shoes. That Cassandra had managed to put together some reasonable work wear in such a short time was an indicator to Captain Percy that she might work out. 

Percy was always on the lookout for little signs that a crew member might last beyond a single run. Green crew came and went on submarines like late-spring snows. A captain could hire a few in one port and they would all leave at the next, replaced by equally unskilled new crew. It was an incredibly tough job, and only a certain toughness of character managed to continue in the lifestyle. The others gave up eventually, and, presumably, they made their way back to the surface world to see what kind of life they could eek out under the domination of one Territorial Authority or another.

Captain Percy tapped Hemi and nodded in the direction of Cassandra huffing her way down to the docking bay. "That's our new sonar watch person." She said.

Hemi looked up from his clipboard and sized Cassandra up for a moment. "Well, I hope she can steer or hear, because I don't know what else we could do with her."

"We could make her Deck Boss."

"Or Captain."

Cassandra made her way up to them, working her way through the remaining crates.

"Cassandra." Said Percy. "I'm glad you made it. This is Hemi, Deck Boss, First Mate, Navigator, crew trainer, whatever else needs to be done. Basically he's the one who does all the work."

"Nice to meet you Hemi." Cassandra said politely. Percy could have sworn if she were wearing a skirt and unburdened by all the possessions she owned she would have curtsied.

"Genuinely glad to have you aboard." Said Hemi. "We desperately need more hands, and with you taking a watch we all might actually be able to get a little sleep on this run."

Cassandra smiled up at Hemi.

Hemi gestured with the end of his pencil. "Down that ladder into the boat. Walk up the catwalk til you get to the main decks of the boat. Introduce yourself to anyone who doesn't look like one of these mounds." He nodded towards the men working on loading the explosives. "Ask where the crew quarters are, you should be able to find an empty locker to stow your stuff in there. Then make your way up to the sonar compartment and hang around there until someone asks you to do something."

"Alright." Said Cassandra. "And I'll get some training at some point?"

"Not until we're under way. Getting the boat ready for a run takes a lot of prep as you can see and there's no extra time for anything but prep. Once we're under way there will be some downtime and I'll sit with you at the sonar and show you how it works."

"Sounds good. So I'll see you both later. Thanks again for the job." She gave a little wave and looked down the ladder into the cargo hold before tossing the bags in her hand down the catwalk, and then swinging her tiny self out onto the ladder with her big pack behind her like some kind of distended insect and lowering herself down to the catwalk.

Percy watched this approvingly. It was another good sign that Cassandra seemed so intuitively comfortable with the vertical up-and-down lifestyle of a submarine.

Hemi didn't fail to notice either. "Maybe..." was all he said before looking back down at his clipboard and counting how many more crates remained to be loaded.


### Next morning; loading compressed air

They finished loading the crates of explosives that evening. Hemi had Bastian, Gregory, and Owen go over every crate and make sure it was lashed securely enough that it couldn't shift once the _Prospect_ started moving. After that, most of the crew hit the rack, though Hemi and Percy were up late in the galley going over the details of their supplies and some questions in the details of the job contract that Hemi wanted Percy to consider.

The next morning, Hemi was up first, and dragged Bastian out of the rack to help him track down some dock workers who would have the rig to get the compressed air tanks of the _Prospect_ recharged. This involved setting up a length of expandable rigid pipes that ran the docking bay, through the cargo hatch, and had to be connected up to pipe fittings mounted to the ceiling of the _Prospect's_ cargo bay. It had to be rigid pipe the whole way because Hemi wanted to recharge the high-pressure tanks in the _Prospect_ and that air was under such an immense pressure it would blow apart any kind of flexible pipe material. Once they had the high-pressure tanks filled, Hemi could recharge the low-pressure tanks as well by utilizing some valves on the tank ballast panel in the control room to bleed off some air from the high-pressure system to the low-pressure tanks.

The docking bay had high-pressure pipes that were fed down from tanks and compressors in some equipment space up above the exchange floor of the depot. Mostly it was just kept ready for an emergency, if the docking bay got flooded and the water needed to be blown out. Most subs that docked there had their high-pressure tanks fully charged, since they had to be ready for their own emergencies at any time. Refilling a docked submarine's high-pressure tanks was an unusual operation. The docking bay had equipment for it, but only a handful of people knew how to use it. So Hemi spent the first few hours of the morning wandering around the docking bay and the exchange floor with Bastian looking for those people.

By the time they got back, the rest of the crew was out of their racks, fed and coffeed, and doing odd jobs around the boat while waiting for Hemi to get back with instructions for things that actually needed to get done. Hemi sent Gregory and Cassandra up to the exchange floor with a stack of coins to track down enough food and consumable supplies to get them through the run ahead of them. He figured Cassandra had been in this depot long enough that she might be able to help Gregory acquire some better-than-average submarine grub. Chips had Owen down in the engine room going over the diesels and the motors very carefully and Hemi was neither going to disrupt Chips in that process, nor take Owen from her for something else.

Hemi and Bastian worked with the two men who knew how to rig the high-pressure pipes until they have a spindly and unwieldy-looking hook of pipe that arced through the air from the docking bay down into the _Prospect_. It took a while to get all the piping set up and double checked so that everyone working on it was confident it wasn't just going to explode and blow every submarine off the docking bay when they let the high-pressure air into it. But once it was set up, charging the high-pressure tanks only took a few minutes.

With the compressed air systems recharged, the only thing left was to get food aboard. Gregory and Cassandra returned a couple of hours later with a cart full of yet more wooden crates, though these were filled with food stores. Gregory and Bastian got these crates lowered down to the cargo bay floor with Cassandra watching a learning. Once they were in the cargo bay, Bastian stowed and lashed the crate full of non-perishable and dry goods --- cans and dried meats, oatmeal, cornmeal, flour, apples, rice, eggs, cabbage, jars of spices, and citrus --- with the rest of the cargo, figuring they could move the contents up to the galley after they were under way. The frozen and perishable items --- sides of beef and pork, a couple of waxed-paper boxes of leafy vegetables they would need to cook in the next few days, frozen chicken carcasses, and ice cream sandwiches and bars among other things --- were all laboriously pully fom the crates immediately and carried up into the galley and freezers by the crew.


### ready to embark

With food aboard, Hemi found Captain Percy in the sonar compartment around lunch time and reported that all the various umbilicals had been withdrawn and the _Prospect_ was ready to swim under its own power agail. They could expect to be ready to embark from the depot sometime that day.

"I don't know if you have any business left to take care of up on the exchange floor or anything," said Hemi to Captain Percy, "but the cargo is loaded, all the critical supplies are aboard, Chips says the engines are running cleanly enough, and the boat is more or less repaired."

"Nice work Hemi. Do we have any money left?"

"Well, we've been spending coin with a shovel to get this all done quickly. But even covering Shake's costs, we should still come out a bit ahead."

"Clandestine work does pay, don't it?" Percy smiled.

"If it doesn't kill you in the process."

Bastian's tall skinny form suddenly filled the hatchway forward to the next compartment. He stood aside and one of the scruffy young teenagers who hung around the depot looking for various quick jobs they could take stepped into the sonar compartment.

"Captain Percy, this kid says he has a message for you."

The kid didn't say anything but handed Percy a scrap of paper and then stood to one side looking at the floor.

Percy unfolded the paper. Written in a slightly wavery hand with printed capital letters said: IT'S TIME TO LEAVE.

Hemi put a couple of things together. "A message from our employer?"

"Indeed." Said Percy. "Raise the blue peter Hemi. I think we need to be moving on from this place."

Hemi nodded and climbed up to the control room. A second later his voice reverbrated through the ship on the PA telling the crew to prepare to embark.

"Bastian," said Percy, "get on the sonar rig and have a listen."

Bastian sat down at the sonar station, and put the headphones over his ears, and fipped on the power to the unit. "Is there anything in particular I'm listening for here Captain? We are docked after all. Probably not much to hear."

"It's just a feeling, not something particular. But I'd like to keep the surprises to a minimum." Percy looked at the messenger. "Hang out a second kid. I think I've got another job for you."

The kid spun the chair next to Bastian around and sat down in a long-legged slouch.

"Hemi!" Percy called up to him in the control room. "Start working that embark checklist."

"Already started it." He called back down.

Gregory and Cassandra showed up in the sonar compartment a minute later, ready for instructions for prepping the boat to leave.

"Gregory, take Cassandra and go find a dock crew who can work the other side of the slip hatch. Be ready to seal the _Prospect's_ cargo hatch when you hear from Hemi." She looked at the messenger. "But make sure this kid is off before you do."


### the sinking of the inspection sub

As Gregory and Cassandra started making their way forward Bastian broke in. "Captain Percy, There's definitely something happening out there." He paused for a minute, listening. "There's a torpedo in the water!"

Percy pushed past the messenger kid and put on the spare sonar headset. She stood behind Bastian, concentrating on the sound in the headphones.

She could hear the unmistakable high-pitched whine of a torpedo prop spinning quickly. She reached over Bastian, and adjusted the direction of the underwater mics. She looked at the readings from the sonar panel. "It's running just at the surface." She said. "It's not coming towards, us or the depot... some other target..."

She slowed her breathing and listened to the sounds in the headset. It was a confused mix of white noises layered on top of one another. But there was more than one prop spinning in the water. Below the whine of the torpedo, she could hear the slow revolutions of a ship screw. It was nearly silent, and difficult to hear. She leaned over Bastian and flipped some switches adjusting the filters to try to muffle the torpedo whine.

She could tell by the revolutions and the pitch that the other prop belonged to a relatively small craft. Had to be an electric motor it was so quiet, so that made it a submarine. It took her just a second longer to figure it out. "Someone fired on the depot's little inspection sub." She said.

"Maybe someone wasn't enamored with the quality of their hospitality." Said Bastian.

The little inspection sub was pretty maneuverable, and they were taking evasive action. Percy could hear the pitch of the screw change in her headphones, as they turned and dove to try to escape the path of the incoming warhead. Then she heard the ping of the torpedo's sonar and the echo off the small submarine. 

"The torpedo found them. It's homing." Bastian commented. A slow minute ticked by, every second the bouncing ping of the torpedo got faster in Percy's headset. She motioned to Bastian and they both took their headsets off. There was silence in the sonar room. The messenger kid managed to look bored. 

Then they all heard a low-pitched rumble echo through the hull of the _Prospect_.

"Sounded like they've been hit." Hemi shouted down from the control room.

Percy put the headphones on and made some further adjustments to the filter switches. She could hear the creaking hull of the small submarine. She could hear streams of bubbles pouring out of it. She looked at the ranging readout on the sonar rig. The water was deep where they were. It was going down into the hole. 

"They've been sunk." Percy said, turning her head slightly and pitching her voice loud enough for Hemi to hear.

In her headphones the groaning hull's pitch changed as it dropped further down the water column into the colder, denser water where sound found new rules by which it could propagate itself. The groan turned to a low rattling whine.

And then Percy heard a crunching pop. She could hear a huge bubble of air escape, the life-bubble of whoever was inside that submarine, squeezed out of it instantaneously as the broken little sub sank beyond its crush depth. The carcaoss of sub made no more sound, but she sat listening for a few seconds to the rush of the huge bubble climbing to the surface.


### they throw lines

Captain Percy took of the sonar headset and laid it on its hook. "We gotta get out of here." She said. Then louder, so Hemi could hear. "Hemi! We need to get out of here!"

Bastian nodded, the other sonar headset still on his ears.

"Right Percy. I concur." Said Hemi from above.

"Here kid." Percy ripped a piece of scrap paper from the pad at Bastian's elbow. She scribbled on it with a pencil and handed it to the messenger. "That's for a guy who goes by 'Shakes.' He's got a small sub boat at one of the slips. Find him and give him that message." She dug a few coins from her pocket and handed them to him.

The messenger was off with an energy one would never have suspected by the lethargy he had been sitting with just a few moments before.

Hemi's voice came over the PA. "Everyone be ready to toss lines. Gregory, get the cargo hatch buttoned up, and let me know when you're ready. Owen, come up to the control room."

"I hope we didn't forget anything." Bastian said.

"I'd rather leave some stuff behind than be sucked onto a slip when whoever fired that torpedo arrives here." Said Percy.

Gregory's voice came over the ship PA. "Hemi, the cargo hatch is sealed and flooded. You can let go the docking clamps whenever you're ready. Cassandra and I will head towards the sonar compartment."

Percy could hear Hemi's voice take on a soft professional tone as he got on the ship-to-ship radio and notified the docking control office they intended to depart.

A minute later Owen appeared. He took a rag from a hook on the wall and wiped his hand that were blackened with grease.

Percy motioned him up the ladder. "I think Hemi wants you in one of the control seats. We gotta get out of here. Is Chips ready to go down there?"

"Well, she's got all the plugs out of one of the diesels to gap and clean 'em." he answered her as they were both climbing into the control room. "She's not going to be thrilled about finishing that while the boat is moving. And she cursed Hemi up and down the meridian for requesting me up here."

"That's a minor job, she can handle it on her own. And we'll be running on batteries for quite a while, so she can take her time getting that diesel running clean."

"Owen, I need you up here in the throttle seat." Hemi said when they were standing in the control room.

Gregory arrived a few moments later and Hemi moved him into the other control seat.

"No problem with the dock crew getting the hatch sealed?" Hemi asked Gregory.

"Well, after that explosion sound, the whole dock went a little crazy. I think a lot of submariners took that as a sign to leave. But for a couple of coins I got that messenger kid to seal up the dock side hatch and flood it for us.

"Nice work." Said Hemi.

Percy looked down through the hatch to the sonar compartment and saw Cassandra standing quietly off to the side. Captain Percy leaned down and motioned to the second sonar operator's seat and the spare headset. "Sit over there Cassandra. Put that headset on, and start to familiarize yourself with the sonar rig."

Cassandra moved to sit down next to Bastian without a word.

It was time for Captain Percy to get her boat out from under the docking bay.  "So we're ready to go, right?" She asked Hemi.

"Right." Replied Hemi. "I've been keeping the tanks trimmed with just a bit of positive buoyancy while we've been docked, to keep us pressed firmly up against the mating collar of the slip. So we'll have to take on some water after we release."

Percy nodded. It was a standard maneuver for a docking situation like this one. "OK, let go the docking clamps." 

Hemi picked up the ship-to-ship mic and told the docking control office they were leaving. He didn't wait for them to reply before reaching over and flipping the switch that operated the powerful electro-magnets in the docking clamps. The clamps reversed with a loud clunk that echoed up the length of the _Prospect's_ hull.

"I'm going to open the main ballast vent valves." Hemi warned the control room. He stepped up to the tank trim control panel, and flipped the switches for the main ballast valves. 

There was a his off air escaping from the boat and the _Prospect_ fell slowly downwards under their feet. 

"We're off the dock. Put us in reverse and back us away from the dock. No reason to risk hitting the sail trying to swim under the dock tube."

Owen pulled the throttle controls backwards, and they felt a small acceleration towards the rear.

"Control room!" Bastian shouted up from the sonar station. "There's boats everywhere in the water. Seems like no one wants to be hanging around this place anymore. You're going to have to move slowly to get out of here without hitting one of them."

"The last thing any of them want is to move slowly and cautiously right now, of course." She said to Hemi.

"That might be exactly what whoever fired that torpedo was thinking." Put in Gregory. "Scare all the rats away and take the cheese for themselves."


### They escape under the pursuing sub

Hemi was too busy considering his options to respond though. He was counting seconds to himself, reckoning how much time there was until the _Prospect's_ bow was backed out from under the dock. As soon as he was sure they were clear, he leaned over Owen and put the throttle slightly into the forward position, waited until the boat slowed to nearly a stop and then backed off to no throttle. It was too dangerous to keep reversing --- there was no way to know if another boat was behind them. "Bastian, I need sea room --- some safe space to maneuver in."

"Right Hemi, hang on!" A full minute passed. "It sounds like you can come about to 180, nobody moving directly to the south of us."

"OK then, Owen, creep forward, port to 180 degrees." Hemi said. "Bastian, make sure we're not headed into anyone."

"Right Hemi!" Bastian called up from below.

The _Prospect_ put a tiny, silent amount of speed on. They crawled out of the docking area, with Bastian, swinging the sonar mics back and forth rapidly, trying to make sure he was hearing every contact, and understood where each was going. It was a good first lesson in sonar for Cassandra, though she found herself wildly confused by all the different sounds, their meanings, and their correlations to the range and heading calculations. She listened with a anxious look on her face.

"You'll get the hang off it eventually," Bastian said to her. "Or... you won't. Seems to me like people either get sonar, or they don't. There's no in between."

Cassandra hardly looked reassured.

"Hemi!" Bastian called up. "New contact, coming in fast from the east, port-side." A few seconds passed. "I'd say, fairly big sub. Fully submerged, and just charging towards the docking area."

"That's probably the one that did the firing." Said Hemi to Percy.

"Let's put some distance between us and that boat." Said Percy.

Hemi understood immediately that when Percy said 'distance' she did not mean horizontal distance, like on a chart. To achieve that kind of distance would require increasing speed, and increasing speed would create enough motor noise that they would be heard and tracked. Hemi looked at the depth-under-keel gauge, already showing a hundred meters or so to the bottom and dropping fast as they moved away from the seamount the depot island was the top of. "Some distance downward it is, Captain. Gregory, down plane please."

As Gregory turned the dive plane wheel and steered the boat into the depths, Hemi stepped over to the tank control panel and opened the valve to flood the forward dive tank. Water sloshed through the ship, and the bow pitched downward. Percy and Hemi, standing, grabbed for straps.

Percy reached for some switches on the wall that changed the lighting to night lighting. The white lights faded away and red bulbs came on bathing them all in a sanguine glow. It wasn't strictly necessary --- night lighting was really to preserve the night-vision for anyone who needed to look through the periscope --- but Percy was of the school that believed in switching to night lighting in any situation where she needed her crew to remain alert. The red light served as a constant reminder that the situation was not totally nominal.

"Keep us close to the seamount." Said Percy. "It will give us extra cover if they decide to use their fish-finder."

"No reason not to make a tricky operation even tricker." Said Hemi. "Bastian, are we clear of the traffic abandoning the depot?"

"Ya," said Bastian, "they all scattered pretty quickly."

"Any of them going deep?"

"Doesn't sound like it. I think we're the only ones who took that route."

Hemi had Owen bring the bow around, and they sank obliquely, traveling close to and across the sloping wall of the seamount.

"200 meters down. Depth-under-keel: 20 meters to the wall of the seamount." Said Gregory.

Hemi looked at Percy. He wasn't going to level off the dive until she said so.

"210 meters. Still descending." Said Gregory.

"Ah ya fucking fuckturds!" Chips voice came up from the sonar compartment where she had just entered. "Is your fucking goal to see if you can split open that fucking weak-ass seam those fucking mountain trolls welded in the cargo hold? Because that's what it fucking looks like to fucking me. The very first fucking thing you do off the dock is push the boat the fuck down!"

Captain Percy pulled out a cigarillo realizing she hadn't had one since the last time the _Prospect_ was moving. "Damn it Chips! If it's going deep or being torpedoed, we're going deep." She sucked on her cigarillo and thought Chips wasn't totally wrong about the quality of the welding work in the cargo hold. "But... let's level her off Gregory."

"Ah fuck! Ya fuckheads are going to want the fucking diesels any fucking minute now too, I'm sure --- and they're in fucking pieces." Chips smacked her hand against the bulkhead and crawled back down towards engineering.

"Leveled out at 220 meters." Said Gregory. "I'm going to make some adjustments to the trim tanks, see if I can get us floating evenly."

As Gregory started opening and closing valves on the trim tank control panel, the hull of the prospect let out a long groan.

"Easy my girl." Percy whispered to her boat.

Hemi watched Gregory's work on the trim, and when he was satisfied he got them moving out into the deep ocean. "Creep speed --- three knots Owen. You can steer us away from the seamount wall now."

They crept slowly away from the depot through the dark deep. The depth-under-keel gauge rapidly climbed until it pegged itself on the 'bottomless' side.

Bastian reported that he thought he could hear some disturbing sounds from the depot, but couldn't pin down any specific thing that might be happening up there.


### looking at the charts

The _Prospect_ continued on its course, slowly, silently, and steadily through the blackness under more than two hundred meters of water. After a couple of hours of creeping, Percy flipped the white lights back on which everyone understood to mean the situation had returned to nominal, even though it was really a meaningless gesture.

"Hemi, join me at the navigation station, it's time for us to figure out where we're going." Said Percy.

The climbed down the ladder and turned the lights on over the navigation table. Hemi unsealed and unrolled a new chart, and laid it down under the glass. He wiped the old grease pencil marks off the glass with a rag.

"I picked up a more up-to-date chart at the depot." Hemi said. "Look, the depot is here. And..." He looked at some notes on their current course and speed that he had jotted on a clipboard over the last couple of hours, then put a small x on the glass, not far from the deserted island that held the depot. "I estimate we're about here now."

Percy pointed to a hashed arc that ran across the chart passing by one side of the depot island. "Is that the current Authority demarcation line?"

"Yes." Said Hemi. "Western Federated Socialists on the east side of it, Consolidated States of the Archipelago Islands on the west side of it." He looked at the date printed in the corner of the chart. "At least as of the printing of this chart, eight months ago."

"So Shakes' line wasn't that far off."

"Not bad for off the top of a tweaker head like that." Hemi agreed.

Percy indicated an arcing course on the chart with the tip of her finger. "We should head that way, I think." She indicated a point on the arc. "And I asked Shakes to rendezvous with us here. I hired him to help us out on this run."

"Good. And yes, further into the Consolidated States waters will be better. They are far less likely to bother us, and we can travel for a few days while remaining in their waters. But..." He took another chart from the stack of rolled charts and unrolled it in front of Percy. "We have to head through these waters in the south. A highly contested area. At least three, up to five Authorities all claiming parts of it."

"Well, we'll just have to be careful when we move through there. Be disciplined about running on the surface only at night, and max out our underwater time."

"...In addition to the regular trouble we might encounter with Authorities, there's also that sub with the ram."

"You think they are specifically after us?"

"My guess is they are the ones who fired on the depot patrol sub. It's possible they followed us there."

"Ah, you're paranoid. Why would anyone be after us?"

"Because we're hauling weapons parts?"

"They rammed us before _we_ knew we'd be hauling weapons parts!" Percy said exasperatedly. "Either it's something else, or, more likely I say, it was all just coincidence."

Hemi nodded, but didn't look convinced.

"This isn't a rush job Hemi. We have the time to take it slow and do the stealth thing right. Let's just be careful, be silent, and not be found. We'll deliver the cargo, collect our money, and by that time we'll be a few territories away --- an entirely different part of the world --- from wherever that sub with the ram came from. I'll bet we never see them again."

"I hope you're right. Another thing I wanted to bring up with you is that when we were adjusting the trim it looked like the boat is a little by the bow."

"Hardly surprising, we never seem to be able to load cargo in a way that doesn't throw off the balance."

"True. I'd like to bring some of the guys down to the cargo hold and move cargo back towards the middle of the boat. See if we can get it stowed so it trims more evenly."

"Sure, but lets run a little longer first. At our current rate we've only made maybe a dozen nautical miles from the depot so far."

"Think we can risk a little more speed yet?"

Captain Percy considered. "I think so. Take us up to six knots. Only top sonar people deliberately looking for us could hear us at six knots at this range and depth. In a few hours more, we'll come up a bit shallower and you can start rearraginging the hold."

"Sounds good." Said Hemi as he started climbing back up to the control room to have Owen put a little more speed on.


### trimming the boat to handle the cargo load

Six knots was still slow, but twice the speed they crawled away from the depot at. With three more hours of crusing they were out of range of all the but the top sonar gear and ears in the world. Percy had them come up to 100 meters to take some of the strain off the hull.

At the shallower depth, Hemi stood at the tank trim control panel and made adjustments, pushing water back and forth across the boat. "Yeah Percy," he said to her as she stood behind him smoking, "I think we can certainly do better if we move some of the cargo around down in the hold.."

"OK. Take Owen and Bastian down there with you. I'll watch the trim with Gregory in case she starts to lean or something. Keep in mind that it might be bad if you drop any of those crates."

Hemi tapped Owen on the shoulder and they climbed down to the sonar compartment where Bastian joined them on the trip down to the cargo hold.

When they stuck their noses into the cargo hold and Hemi brought the lights up, it still smelled a little damp. Hemi was certain the quilted patchwork of steel and frozen slag that covered the split seam of the hull was still seeping. They might never have a completely dry cargo hold again. That was OK, that's what bilge pumps were for. But the accumulating bilge water was another good reason to shift the cargo and get some play in the boat trim.

Gregory had stacked the wooden crates into the hold inexpertly. There was a bit of an art to it, and Gregory had only the beginnings of the skill needed. The crates had been initially laid down all the way up and down the length of the hull along the sides. This was a good start, forming the base for putting the rest of the crates on the top. But then Gregory had gotten lazy and stacked the additional layers of crates mostly towards the bow. That was easier to do and kept the crates out of the way for crew moving in and out of the cargo bay, but put more weight in the bow than Hemi wanted. They needed to move some of the upper layers of the crates in the front towards the rear of the cargo bay while still leaving enough room for the crew to get through the crates.

Hemi had Owen rig a block and chain to sliding fixtures on the roof of the cargo bay. Then Owen would climb up on the stack and throw straps around each crate they wanted to move. Hemi and Bastian would pull the chain through the tackle while Owen guided it off the stack. The three of them would then pull the airborne crate up the length of the cargo bay, and Owen and Bastian would push it with poles while Hemi lowered it to it's new place.

It took a few hours to make a first pass at rearrangin the crates. When Hemi felt like the weight distribution might be good, he left Owen and Bastian smoking in the cargo hold while he ran up to the control room. There, Hemi and Percy made adjustments to the trim of the boat and Hemi went back down to the cargo hold to move a few more crates around. It took another hour and three more trips up to the control room before Hemi was happy with the way the cargo sat and the boat was trimmed.

"Fuckin' Christ Hemi," said Gregory when Hemi was finally settled back into the control room, "seemed like the boat was trim enough when we left the depot. Didn't slow us down none."

"A submarine is like the hairs on the back of your neck, Gregory. It _always_ needs a trim."


### Training Cassandra on sonar

Hemi knew Captain Percy would keep the same course, depth, and speed until well after dark, and that was still a few hours off yet, so there was little for him to do for the moment. He took the opportunity to start training Cassandra on sonar. In the sonar compartment, he sent Bastian off for coffee and a smoke and sat down next to Cassandra.

"You've been listening for the last few hours while Bastian worked the sonar, right?" Hemi asked her.

Cassandra nodded.

"Any of it make any sense?"

"Do you want me to lie?" Cassandra asked.

"Don't worry about. It's not as complex as it might seem. Except for the parts that are, but we'll get to those as we come to them. Put your headset over both ears... you need both ears to get a full sense of what any sound you hear on sonar is doing."

Cassandra adjusted the headset so it sat evenly with the headphones covering both her ears. The band matted down her hair where it crossed her head. 

"OK" said Hemi as he began adjusting and tuning the sonar unit "this is the 'passive' sonar rig. It's nothing more than microphones for listening underwater. There's 'active' sonar too -- that's a lot more complicated: the sonar sends a ping out and we listen for it's echo. We don't use that very often so don't worry about it for now. Passive is simpler, you're just listening, passively. Get it?"

Cassandra nodded.

"The main thing you need to know for operating the sonar is that you can aim the underwater microphones in a specific direction using this big wheel." Hemi turn the stainless steel wheel a half turn. "See that dial there? That shows you which way the microphones are pointed, it goes around 360 degrees. At some point someone will ask you to listen in a specific direction. They will give you the degrees and you just turn the wheel until the needle on that dial shows you are aiming the mics in the direction they are asking about. Make sense?"

"That seems simple enough." Said Cassandra.

"That part is. It will get a lot more complex when we start using the filters and transducers to tune in on a contact later. The thing is, the ocean is never absolutely silent. Let's start by just listening to what we hear on the sonar if there's no specific contact we're trying to focus in on." Hemi and Cassandra both remained quiet for a minute with the background sound of the ocean washing through their headphones. "OK Cassandra, what do you hear?"

"I don't know..." She waved one small hand around in the air absently. "White noise?"

"Almost anything could be white noise. Describe it with more detail than that."

"There's... a low rumble, a bit of a swishing sound..."

"Good. We're running on the electric motor, underwater, at a modest speed. That's what it sounds like when the boat is moving like that. Later, when we're near the surface with the diesel engines running, it'll be a lot louder and you won't be able to hear much in the water beyond the engines. But while we're on the electric motor, we can hear more on sonar. Sonar requires immagination. You have to put your mind out there in the water. When you hear a sound, you have to match it to an image in your head that describes how the sound could be made. The more detail you can imagine in the image to fit it to the sound, the more accurate your assessement of the contact will be. That's what makes a top sonar person." 

Hemi pointed to the largest of a set of gauges further up the wall in front of them.

"Now, the gauge above the directional indicator is the main signal strength indicator. All those smaller gauges above that show signal strength at different frequencies, but you only need to worry about this main signal strength indicator for now. Watch that needle, if you see it jump, there's a significant sound out there in the water, and you'll want to listen to it and try to figure out what it is. " 

"Let's see..." Hemi turned the direction dial slowly. About a quarter of the way around the strength indicator dial moved up a little and wavered there. "So there's something to hear in this direction. What do you hear in your headset now?"

Cass listened, her eyes watching the signal strength indicator needle wavering like a humming bird feeding. It was moving in response to another kind of white noise, higher pitched than the sub's engines, which she could still hear rumbling in lower frequencies. This sound was familiar, a washing, churning sound with an occasional rumble mixed in... She smiled, "it's breaking surf isn't it?"

"Correct! There's a small atoll a few miles in that direction and waves are breaking on it's shore. Let's see what else is out there." Around the directional needle went, and Hemi slowed it, and stopped with the strength indicator needle throbbing slightly, like it had a pulse.

Cass closed her eyes. In her headphones she could hear a distant clicking, slow and regular. The clicks had a richness to them, they bounced around the underwater landscape, and she could hear not just the clicks but also the echoes of the clicks. The dark world out there lit up in her mind, and she remembered storybooks about sea life from not so very long ago when she was a child. "Is that the sound dolphins make?" She asked.

"Very good! Dolphins use active sonar, boucing sounds they make off of underwater objects to locate them. They are much better at it than we are. Did you notice that you could hear the dolphins in one ear slightly before the other?"

Cassandra nodded again.

"That's because the sonar uses two sets of microphones, one on the front of the boat, and one at the rear. Sound coming in hits one microphone before the other, and the sonar rig puts the difference into the earphones for you. With practice, you can use the difference in how long it takes to estimate how far away a contact is, for instance, I can tell you these dolphins are about a third of a mile away. That only works if the contact is close enough that we can hear the difference though. If you think about it, if a contact is farther away the sound will hit both the microphones on the bow of the _Prospect_ and the stern at basically the same time." 

"OK, yah, that makes sense." Said Cassandra, picturing the sound waves bouncing off the boat in her head.

Hemi smiled. "Miss Cassandra, you may have a career ahead of you. Keep practicing until we surface and start the diesels later tonight. You won't be able to hear anything after that."

"OK Hemi. Thanks for the lesson."

Hemi left her there listening to the dolphins and climbed up next to Percy in the control room.

"How'd she do?" Asked Percy.

"We may have a pair of ears yet."

"That would be a nice change. Most of these fuckers are OK at rudimentary steering, but they're useless on sonar."


### they surface at night

A few hours later the clocks and sun charts coordinated to tell them that it was well after dark on the surface. Percy had them come up to periscope depth and she put the scope up to check the surface. With an empty black horizon in all directions, she had Gregory blow air into the main ballast tanks from the low-pressure system and raise the _Prospect_ fully up to the surface.

Captain Percy's standard strategy for a cargo run was to stay underwater and run slow on the batteries during the day, and surface to run on the diesels at night. Running on the disels meant moving much faster and recharging the ship's batteries at the same time. Even with all the shipping traffic, the oceans were still mostly huge open spaces. A submarine running with no lights on the surface at night was a dark and tiny target, unlikely to be spotted by anyone. The main risk was being tracked by radar --- on the surface they created a fairly strong radar signature. But they ran their own radar receiver while on the surface. If anyone else was tracking with radar, they would see the signal and know they were there, usually with plenty of time for the _Prospect_ to disappear underwater and change course.

The only other way they might be found is if an Authority ship heard the _Prospect's_ rumbling diesel on sonar. But to do that they would have to be within ten or twenty nautical miles of the _Prospect_, not an impossible scenario, but unlikely on any normal night of a cargo run.

Captain Percy also always kept one more ancient backup system for spotting any trouble early: she put someone up in the lookout ring with binoculars. As soon as the deck was above the surface of the water, Percy and Hemi went up through the top hatch in the control room and climbed to the bridge well at the top of the sail. Percy had the radar mast raised, which had two lookout rings mounted to it, one on either side, and called Owen up. As he came up onto the bridge she handed him binoculars and pointed to the lookout rings. Owen kept climbing.

Percy looked at Hemi. "Be glad you don't have to do lookout duty anymore."

"I am." Said Hemi. "I remember it well. At night, you're just standing up there in the wind, like you are swimming through pure blackness. Your mind starts to play tricks on you when you most need to keep your mind clear. It's a young person's job."

"Reliable young people, anyway." Said Percy. "Hey down there in the control room," she shouted down through the hatch, "you can start the diesels."

There was a moment more of the quiet of the water sloshing down the length of the hull pushed by the electric motors before the diesels deep in the belly of the _Prospect_ coughed and fired. Black smoke streamed out behind the sail. The vibration of the engines carried up up through the deck and shook the soles of their feet.

Hemi called down to ask for their new speed and to confirm the heading. He marked the answers down carefully on his ever-present clipboard.

"I heard that some boats like the _Prospect_ are being fitted with snorkels now." Said Hemi.

"That's what they're calling those masts you can raise for feeding oxygen to the diesels while underwater, right?"

"Yes. The diesels exhaust out of them too. A boat with a snorkel never has to come up to the surface, you can recharge the batteries from periscope depth."

"We should look into installing one at some point. Maybe after this run. It seems like it would be worth the investment. The nighttime surface runs are starting to require too much care and caution for me to feel safe."

"The funny thing," Hemi continued, "is I also heard that a snorkeling diesel is actually louder on sonar than one running on the surface."

"You're kidding?"

"No. Apparently with the whole boat underwater more of the sound of the running engines goes into the water. On the surface, some of it escapes into the air. Nobody expected that when they came up with the idea of the snorkel, but the boats out in the ocean were suddenly detectable 40 miles off or so on sonar."

"So once again the new-fangled technology doesn't solve a problem, it just creates more options for a captain to have to make decisions about." Percy rolled her eyes.

"It's certainly not a job I would ever want. I prefer a measure of certainty in my work."

Percy lit a cigarillo. Hemi looked up at the dark gray sky, mostly obscured by cloud cover.

"How's the navigation going?" Percy exhaled a long stream of smoke that was caught up by the wind and tied into the diesel exhaust behind them.

"I've been keeping very close track of our time, direction and speed, as usual." Said Hemi. "But you know that's only as good as guesswork can be. If these clouds break up tonight and we get some stars, I would like to fix our position on the chart. When is the rendezvous with Shakes?"

"At dawn. It will certainly be easier if we know where we are with some precision."

"And if we can rely on Shakes to know where he is..."

The night ground on with the unvarying drone of the diesel engines always under the foot of any crew members on deck, and relentlessly surrounding them anywhere below deck. Since the diesel engines of the _Prospect_ were just generators that created electricity to charge the batteries and run the electric motors that actually propelled the boat, they were always run at the same, optimum RPMs. Even when the boat changed speed, the all-consuming hum around them never changed in pitch or amplitude. For crew at the controls, with no depth to control while they were on the surface, and a steady course, there was almost nothing to do. The needles of the rows of gauges all stood steadfastly at their marks. 

Percy knew that this was the hardest part of the job --- keeping always ready to do something when there was absolutely nothing to do. They had to stay focussed on the job during hours and hours of virtually no sensory input at all. It was far too easy to fall asleep at the controls, or let one's mind wander off to a place where everything wasn't just a grime-coated gray accompanied by a background of lush and never-changing noise.

She put the crew on rest rotations. Every three hours three of them would get three hours off. This kept two people in the control room at all times, one on lookout, and one at the radar/sonar station. The off-duty crew were free to spend their time on deck if they wanted. But since there was little to see up there but a black horizon tapped against a dark gray one, most of the crew came back down after a few minutes and ended up in their rack sleeping. Except for Bastian. He wrapped his long thin form in a rubber foul-weather slicker to keep the wind off and lay out on the forward deck, apparently finding sleep there as easily as warm puppy.


### Hemi and Cassandra in navigation talking about what it takes to be a submariner

Hours later, sometime during the third rotation, Hemi found Cassandra in the navigation and sonar compartment, listening intently to the sonar with the headphones on and her eyes closed.

Hemi tapped her on the shoulder, and she jumped a little before smiling at him and pulling back a headphone.

"Aren't you supposed to be in your rack?"

"I volunteered to take two rotations in a row, to keep the rotations even for everyone else...and since I'm new."

"Are you hearing anything?" Hemi asked.

"No, I try to imagine my mind going out into the water to listen, but I can't get past the sound of the diesels."

"Sonar is extremely limited with the engines running. But..." Hemi flipped some filter switches on the sonar control board, and adjusted some tone dials. Familiar settings he used when he was on sonar while the engines were running. "Try it like that."

Cassandra set the headphones back into their comfortable position on her ears, and listened for a minute. "That's much better. It's like the engines are at least not distracting my attention." She made some notes on a pad of the settings Hemi had made.

"You're keeping an eye on radar too, right?" Hemi asked. "That's actually maybe more important while we're on the surface."

"Yup. Owen showed me what to look for. The radar... has not done anything at all."

"That's good."

"I didn't realize when I agreed to come on board that this job would be so mind-numbing... and boring."

"That's actually what makes it so hard, and why only a certain type of person makes it as a submariner. I think on land sometimes there's this perception that it's this glorious job, where you're out from under the thumb of Authorities, free to pursue your own career. The people on land know it's dangerous, and that gets mixed into the legend of who a submariner is. But in reality, the people who make good submariners are the ones who can handle being in a cramped space for days on end with no changes in their environment at all, and still keep their mind sharp enough to snap into action when a situation presents itself. It's not a job that's an expression of physical acuity. It's a job that puts your mental toughness to the test."

"I certainly don't have much to offer in physical strengh..." Said Cassandra.

"People on land think it's a job for tough guys, so we're always getting men looking for jobs on submarines. Men who look like, well, like me. Big, muscled guys. And some of those guys are fine. But Percy and I have realized that mental toughness we need isn't correlated to physical toughness. We hire people who we anticipate might have that mental toughness, at least when we have an option in who we can hire. And we find that mental toughness in all kinds of people. It's not just me and Percy, most of the people who actually work in the submarine cargo industry these days look for that mental toughness in all types. The Authority subs are still full of big men, but the commercial subs are pretty diverse."

"The depot was full of big men..."

"You know how that happens? Those men go looking for work on submarines thinking it's a good job for a strong fellow. But they can't handle the mental strain, and they wash out. They end up working the next job out from what the center of what they went looking for: _servicing_ submarines instead of working on them."

Cassandra's eyes widened. "Ah..." She said as large piece of her world that didn't quite make sense before fell into place in her mind.

"Unlike work on land, there's few regulations or rules controlling our work out here. The job has strong evolutionary forces in play. The only people doing the work are the ones who _can_. Everyone else goes home, back to their Authorities, and policies, and networks of contacts. On land you get a job based on what you look like, and who you know. Out here, you get a job if you can do the job. We don't care who you know, where you came from, or what you look like."

A smile cracked across Cassandra's face. "That's why you hired me?"

"No, no no. Captain Percy hired you because she was desperate for someone to sit on sonar. But you should know that you have just as good a chance at doing this job well as any other person. And... you've done well on your first day working."

Cassandra nodded.


### Taking a siting by the stars

"I want to learn as much as I can." Said Cassandra. "What are you up to at this hour of the night Hemi?"

"I'm catching up on navigation. I have to do this every few hours. Come over here and look at the chart."

Cassandra joined Hemi at the navigation table. She looked at the big chart, and the dotted line marking their course from the depot isladn, and the little x marking their current position. "How the heck do you know where we are?" She asked.

"Honestly, it's mostly just a guess. I keep track of our speed and direction very carefully. Then I just plot that onto the chart based on how long we have been traveling. That's called dead-reckoning. If the chart is accurate and there's not too many mitigating factors, like, say, a strong current that I can't account for, then we know roughly where we are and that we won't run into anything."

"What happens if there is a strong currently the pushes you off course and you don't realize it?"

"That's why we need to sometimes fix our position. If we pass by an island  or other feature that we see while on the surface or with the periscope, and that feature is on the chart, then we know where we are. Sometimes there's undersea features that we can hear on the sonar or we know are there by changes we read in the gauge that mesures how far down the bottom is. If those are on the chart, we can fix our position that way. Normally, we don't have to be super-precise --- the ocean is large and mostly empty water --- especially this early into a run. I know exactly where we started from at the depot, so our position shouldn't be too far off. But we need to rendezvous with Shakes at dawn, and being precise about our location will help that go more smoothly. So I'm going up on the bridge to get a fix by the stars. Want to join me? If the stars are out, it might be worth the trip up the ladder."

"Is it OK for me to leave the radar?"

"Just for a few minutes. Make sure to check it as soon as you come back down."

They climbed up through the control room and up the sail interior ladders to the bridge. Owen was back up in the lookout ring and greeted them when their heads shadowed the light coming up from the open hatch, happy to have something to break the monotony of being on lookout.

Overhead the clouds had blown off leaving a clear night sky with no moon. Hemi often remarked that the number of times the _Prospect_ surfaced and he came out on deck to find a low, blanketing cloud cover occurred far more often than was statistically probable. He could hardly recall the last time they surfaced to a clear sky and his deeply-rational self was challenged by the sense that being on the open surface was in fact nature's opportunity to opress them. He had begun to prefer being submerged, where instead they had control over the pressure and depth of the atmospheres layin upon them.

But not this night. The sky was clear from one horizon to the other, and the stars glowed in their visible tens-of-thousands, their appreciable numbers a hueristic suggesting the reality of the uncountable multiples of billions of other stars that existed invisibly in the universe above them. With no light over the horizon, the stars came right down to the horizon in every direction, an infinity compressed to a perfectly smooth dome that lay over them.

"Wow." Said Cassandra.

"Yes, that's the mariner's priviledge." Said Hemi. "And the submariner occasionally gets to dip in as well."

Hemi took out his sextant, clipboard, and star charts and graphs. He took sitings on three or four know stars, measuring their precise height above the horizon. He scratched a number of notes onto the clipboard with a pencil.

"How does that thing work?" Cassandra asked.

"This is a sextant. It measures how far above the horizon a particular star or the sun is. That will let me fix our position on the chart. If you are interested, I can train you how to use it. But not tonight."

Cassandra nodded.

"Unlike mariners, the submariner doesn't often have the luxury of visual references to find their place in the world," Hemi continued, "we wander under the ocean, feeling our way by sound. And every once in a while poke our head up to secure our location in the swiriling mass by judging ourselves against the stars."

"That's poetic." Said Owen, listening to their conversation from the lookout ring.

Hemi smiled, "And just a little bit of a cliche." He said more loudly for Owen's benefit. "I find a touch of the poetic gives some much-needed meaning to this black and gray metal world of ours. But if you let it go to your head, it could keep you from making the clear-minded assessments of situations that are necessary to remain alive as a submariner." Hemi took a siting of another star and marked its altitude down on his clipboard. "OK Cassandra. Back to your radar scope. I need to make some minor course adjustments in the control room."

[//]: # (give cliche accent in above line)

Hemi and Cassandra climbed back down into the _Prospect_ leaving Owen alone to occupy the center point on a circular field of blackness under the perfect half-sphere of stars.


###  Listening for the Gnat

Early in the pre-dawn, Bastian was up in the lookout ring when the sky began to lighten in the east, blacking out the stars in that direction and creating an echo of light on the black disc of the ocean in that direction. When Bastian could see his hands gray in the gloom in front of him, he relayed down to the control room that it might be time to dive.

Captain Percy came up on the bridge and looked around for a few minutes. She took some long breaths, taking in the last of the fresh air before the next twelve hours or so below deck, and then called Bastian to follw her back down into the sub.

They buttoned up the _Prospect_ and when all the hatches showed green lights on the board in the control room, they shut down the diesels and dove the boat down to 50 meters. After leveling off, Hemi had them adjust their course. After fixing their position earlier in the evening, he had slept his three hours, and now wanted to take the boat in a new direction as a precaution against the small chance that anyone had been tracking their course on the surface that they hadn't been aware of. With the cargo they were hauling, Hemi felt there was no reason not use to every stealth maneuver they had.

He had them bring the boat about nearly 100 degrees to starboard. This was backtracking a bit, but they were now aimed directly at the rendezvous point for the _Gnat_, which they would reach in another two hours at their current speed.

The next two hours were nealy silent and uneventful. Everyone had low early-morning energy and no one felt like much of a conversationalist after a long night with short sleep. This was improved after Gregory brought up the first pot of coffee and passed around tin mugs to the crew in the sonar compartment and the control room.

They cruised to the rendezvous point, and then came up to 30 meters of depth. They shut down the electric motor entirely, and Hemi trimmed the boat until it sat perfectly still and silent in the water.

Cassandra was just waking up from her sleep rotation, and groggily making her way from the crew quarters to the sonar compartment when Hemi found her and handed her a tin cup full of sweetened black coffee.

"Time to get back on sonar Cassandra. We've reached the spot where we're supposed to rendezvous with Shakes. I need you to listen for his boat, it's quite a small boat so it might be challenging to hear. But since we've got the _Prospect_ completely shut down you'll have total silence. If you hear Shakes --- or anything else in the water --- come get me, I'll be in the galley. The rest of the crew is going on break while there's nothing to do, so it's all you right now. "

"That makes this sound important... you trust me with this?"

"It's good practice for you, and the worst that could happen is if you miss him and we're a little delayed in the rendezvous. I'd be happier if we got moving again soon though, so... try not to miss him if he goes past."

"OK Hemi." Cassandra sat down at the sonar rig, put the headphonees on, and took a sip of her coffee bwfore swinging the mics in a full circle to get her bearings.

Hemi went off to the galley with his clipboard and notes, and the rest of the crew hit the racks to catch up on much-needed sleep, leaving the _Prospect_ dark and absolutely silent.

Cassandra turned the directional control of the mics slowly around. She completed a full 360 circle, and then came back the other way. Her eyes closed and she could see the sounds in the water coming towards the _Prospect_. The water had slightly different qualities in different directions, so after a few times around she could tell generally which way the microphones were pointing without looking at the directional indicator. When they were forward towards the bow, she could hear the bilge water sloshing in the lowest parts of the ship. And towards the stern she could hear clearly, without the annoying interuption of the propellor sound that was always in that direction when the electric motors were running.

The _Prospect_ was currently at absolute maximum sonar listening capacity, but there was nothing out there. The ocean was completely empty in every direction. Cassandra focused her mind and kept it out in the water. Every time she felt it grasping with some subject other than sonar, she took a deep breath, and forced her mind back out into the water. It was incredibly tiring work.

Two hours later, there remained no sign of Shakes. Captain Percy could never sleep for very long, and so was soon back in the control room with a cup of coffee from the galley, smoking and making small adjustments to the trim of the boat. Each of these adjustements was acompanied by a brieft rush of water or air through the piping of the ship, and each time this happened Cassandra got completely distracted for a few frustrating moments. Cassandra did not yet realize that the sonar operator could, in some instances, have some authority over even the captain on a submarine.

Another hour went by, Cassandra thought she was starting to crack, and considered asking Hemi to take over. She was worried that somehow Shakes had sneaked past her in his little boat, that she missed him and screwed up her first real job. Rationally, she knew that was unlikely though. She pushed herself to keep listening to the silence.

Then, far off their port side, she heard an engine in the water. It wasn't like the other seacraft she had heard so far on sonar. It had a continuous popping sound, like a machine gun being fired off in the distance, accompanied by a low-frequency roar.

"Captain Percy!" Cassandra called up to the control room where Percy still sat fiddling with the controls to her boat. "I hear something."

Percy slid down the ladder and picked up the second sonar headset and put it on. Cassandara, rotated the mics back and forth across the direction of the contact, and settled them in on the strongest signal.

"Is that Shakes' boat?" Cassandra asked doubtfully.

"Jesus." Said Percy. "That can't be Shakes. That sounds like a supertanker or an aircraft carrier or something. Go get Hemi. I think he should hear this."

Cassandra went off to the Galley leaving Percy listening to the contact. She came back with Hemi holding a tin up with the dregs of cold coffe in the bottom. He slipped the headphones on and stood there hold his coffee cup, staring at the gauges on the sonar and watching them bobble up and down. He flipped some filters on, and listened again.

"Well." Hemi said. "That's strange. It does sound like a tanker or something big just from sheer volume. But it's moving very fast, too fast for a big thip. It's closer now and I can hear the prop revolutions..." He paused listening again. "And the freqencies are all wrong. The prop is spinning too fast, and sounds small, not like a big ship screw.

"Shakes was planning to modify the _Gnat_ to be louder, you think that's him?" Percy asked.

"If that's Shakes, I think he's probably overdone it..."

"Well, maybe instead of the _Gnat_ being mistaken for the _Prospect_, instead the _Gnat_ will just drown out _everything_ in a 10 mile radius." Said Percy.

"I just..." Hemi started, "just can't believe that such a small boat could..." he paused listening again. "No, I'm more sure of it now. The more detail I get the more it makes sense that it's a very _very_ loud small boat, not a big ship. Though he does have it tuned so low that from a distance or to anyone who isn't skilled on sonar, they might easily be fooled into thinking that contact is displacing an enormous amount of water. Good job Cassandra."

She smiled.

"OK then. Now what do we do?" Asked Percy. "If we were on the surface, I'd try to raise him on the radio. But I arranged with Shakes to rendezvous at depth, so no one sees us. I'd hate to blow our cover by surfacing now."

"I don't know. He's well out of range of ship-to-ship. I'd guess something like 20 nautical miles off still or so. We could hit them with active."

"If it turns out you're wrong and the contact is actually that sub with the ram on it's bow tearing it's way towards us, then active pinging them will be sending a signal telling them exactly where we are." Captain Percy paused. "We have the advantage of being completely hidden at the moment. I hate to just hand that away."

Hemi shrugged. "That's why I leave that decision to you."

Percy considered. "You are fairly certain it's Shakes?" She asked Hemi.

"I am fairly certain that contact is not the big ship it sounds like." Said Hemi.

"OK, ping it."

"Watch Cassandra. Remember I mentioned 'active' sonar during your first training session? I'm going to use that now." He powered up the active sonar unit. "The principles behind it are much more sophisticated than passive. But it's easy enough to operate." He set the direction indicator to point towards the contact. "Push the PING button Cassandra."

She reached out her small finger and crushed the button home. Even without the sonar headsets they could hear the ping echo through the hull and off into the water. A few seconds later the active unit calculated and displayed the range and direction to the contact.

"The active sonar figures out very precisely where your contact is by calculating how long it takes for that ping sound to bounce back from the target." Hemi said, pointing to the readout on the active sonar unit. "That's very useful if you have to do something like aim and fire a torpedo. But since the _Prospect_ doesn't have torpedoes, we don't often use it."

"The active ping also tells the target exactly where _we_ are." Added Percy. "Normally, we don't want to do that --- never use the active sonar without an explicit instruction from me or Hemi --- but assuming this contact _is_ Shakes..." she looked at Hemi, "then we just deliberately let them know where we are by hitting them with the active ping."

"Let's see what the contact does now." Said Hemi, putting the sonar headset back on as he powered down the active sonar unit.

Within a minute of the _Prospect's_ ping, the contact went silent.

"They're gone?" Asked Cassandra, still listening to the other headset.

"They have shut down their engine." Hemi said. "Which does not tell us anything."

"Well how the fuck was he supposed to respond?" Percy asked Hemi. 

"Can he just ping us back?" Asked Cassandra.

"I do not believe the _Gnat_ has an active sonar system like that." Said Hemi. "We could ping them again? Let them know we aren't going anywhere." He looked over at Percy.

"And then what? What's the full plan here Hemi?" She asked.

"Well, without surfacing, I think we wait until he moves into ship-to-ship range. Then we can confirm it's Shakes that way."

"A quarter of a nautical mile? If it's someone who wants to do unpleasant things to us instead of Shakes, that's awfully close."

"If they want to do unpleasant things, they are likely to begin them long before they are in ship-to-ship range." Said Hemi. "I advise we ping them again. If the contact does anything that seems suspicious, we'll move off from this spot and sneak away quietly."

"...Alright." Said Percy. "Ping them again."

Hemi caught Cassandra's eye and pointed to the PING button. She reached out and pressed it again. Another resonant ping left the _Prospect_ and soared through the water. The range and direction displayed on the active sonar unit.

"See Cassandra, it was like they were invisible while they were being silent, but bouncing the ping off them let us know they are still there. ...And they know we're still here."

Cassandra nodded with one hand on an earpiece. She listened quietly for a minute. Then: "I think I hear something."

Hemi listened closely. "OK, the contact is running on electric motor now. And I can tell by the pitch that it's definitley a small craft moving quickly. Towards us." Hemi listened for a moment longer. "It's definitely the _Gnat_, I recognize it now."

"Thank fuckin' god." Said Percy. "That was ridiculous Hemi. We've got to work out a better way of communicating with the _Gnat_ if we're going to keep working with that guy. We can't be pinging every tanker that goes over us hoping it's really a friendly tiny submarine."

"I'll talk to Shakes about it when we get him on board." Said Hemi.


### Rendezvous with the Gnat

Within an hour, Shakes voice lit up the ship-to-ship radio in the control room. "Break. Break. This is the mighty _Gnat_. Were those ear-splitting pings coming from the folks I'm looking for?"

Hemi climbed up to the control room and took the mic from the overhead radio. "Indeed _Gnat_. This is the _Prospect_ and we are glad to know now that we weren't pinging an Authority battleship."

"Ah." Said Shakes. "So my subterfugal modifications were effective? Wait til you see what I did Hemi. You're going to love it."

Hemi smiled into the mic. "Sounds good Shakes. You didn't break off your mating collar while making those modifications did you?"

"Nope. It's still riding proud on the top of the _Gnat's_ sail. Mating with the _Prospect_ should be at least as smooth as last time."

"I hope it does not go that badly." Said Hemi. "OK, we'll put the _Prospect_ in gear, and drive forward slowly. Just like last time, you can come up underneath, and put the _Gnat_ on the mating collar."

"Roger that. But... you're going to have to come up shallower. The _Gnat_ can't reach you as deep as you are now."

Captain Percy had been listening from the navigation station. Now she climbed up to the control room to sort out the details of this maneuver with Hemi. 

Hemi caught her eye while she was still on the ladder. "Shakes needs us to come shallow."

"How shallow? I'd prefer to keep her as deep as possible."

"I believe the _Gnat's_ maximum depth was around 30 meters --- according to Shake's estimate that was unchallenged by anything like an engineering background."

"Can we do it with the _Prospect_ at 20 meters?" She asked.

Hemi thumbed the mic on the ship-to-ship. "Shakes, what if we make the _Prospect's_ keel 20 meters down. Can you do the mating at that depth?"

"I think so." Replied Shakes crackling voice. "But you'll have to also remember that while the _Gnat_ is attached, you can _not_ go any deeper. Any deeper that 30 meters or so and you'll crush the _Gnat_ and likely flood the _Prospect_ as well."

"I got you Shakes. 20 meters maximum depth it is."


### Shakes back on board

They carried out the maneuver without incident, Shakes brought the _Gnat_ up under the _Prospect_ and connected back up to the mating collar. When he popped the hatch, Chips was there waiting for him, just like last time.

"Ah fuck ya Shakes. At least I didn't have to weld your fuckin' boat back together to get ya on board this fucking time."

"Good to see you again too Chips. I'll have you know my boat has been adjusted and tuned to an absolute fucking precisionmeister's peak of performance. The _Gnat_ is now faster, more maneuverable, and louder than any other boat of its size and displacement."

"Ah, yer the first fucker I've ever met who is proud to have a loud fucking submarine Shakes."

They made their way up to the galley, where Chips left Shakes to go continue working on the efficiences of her own engines down in the engine room. Shakes poured some stale coffee from the pot into a mug and sat down. 

Hemi and Percy joined Shakes in the galley as soon as they got the _Prospect_ settled back on course with Gregory and Bastian at the controls. The boat would spend the remaining hours of daylight running underwater. Hemi did not neglect to warn Gregory to keep a very close eye on the depth and ballast control panel and not let the boat dive any deeper than they already while the _Gnat_ was attached.

"So Shakes," said Percy, settling next to him with her own stale cup of coffee, "you made it out of the depot without a problem?"

"Well, there was in fact a little drama. I'm sure you heard some of it."

"We got a tip to leave before anything very dramatic happened." Said Hemi.

"So I gathered from your note Captain Percy. Unfortunately I was in the middle of some work on the _Gnat_ when I got the note, otherwise I would have left right then myself. The _Gnat's_ engine was in pieces though --- I was putting a new exhaust in that I got in a deal in one of the parts shops on the exchange floor. So I was stuck on the dock when the Authority sub arrived."

"Which Authority sub --- was it the sub with the ram?"

"Well, I couldn't very well see whether it had a ram from inside the docking bay, could I? But if you made me guess, I'd say sure, it was that same sub that kept showing up in your 'scope. ...They specifically asked about you."

"They asked about the _Prospect_ by name?" Percy was horrified that any Authority would know the name of her boat and be going around asking about them.

"Yep. They docked and unloaded a bunch of big goons. Bigger even than those who worked at the depot. Or, better armed and armored at least. The goons tore through the whole depot checking papers at every slip with a sub docked, questioning every person they saw in the docking bay."

"Including you?"

"Including me. That was no trouble, I've got quality papers and stories to put off any Authority inspection long enough for me to tiptoe away."

"They asked you about the _Prospect_?"

"Indeed. A couple of those goons stood over the slip to the _Gnat_ and asked me if I knew anything about a boat named the _Prospect_; small lady captain, big first mate, and a small crew that included a young man among them."

"Strange." Said Hemi.

"By the time they got far enough down the dock to talk to me they had already found out from other sub crew that you had definitely been there... and that you left with a load of magnetic mines."

"They asked you about our cargo too huh?"

"Ya. Fortunately, they didn't seem to know anything about me coming in with you. I guess the other sub crew are afraid enough of Authority goons with guns to give up someone who isn't around, but aren't such cowards as to go so far as to pointing at someone they can see in the same space."

Hemi picked up a spoon and stirred his coffee. 

Captain Percy lit a cigarillo. "Shit." She said. "If they know we've got weapons parts on board, I'm sure they'll consider that justification for shooting to sink us rather than trying to get us to surface for inspection."

"Oh," said Shakes, "I didn't tell you the best part yet... So after they finish questioning me, I discreetly --- and as quickly as I could --- started prepping the _Gnat_ to leave. As I'm on the dock getting some cans of food to load into the hold, I see the commander of the Authority sub climb up out of their sub --- the commander is a real round guy, with only one arm. He wears an Authority uniform with all the trimmings, as if he wears it every day on board the sub. He takes a squad of goons --- maybe twenty of them --- and they go up the dock and out towards the exchange floor.

"Here's the good part: while he's up there, he watertight bulkhead between the docking bay and the upper levels goes into an emergency-close procedure. You know, the whole fuckin' shebang --- the klaxon is blaring, the red lights are spinning. The fucking Authority goons start running around in a panic, probably most of them think the docking bay is flooding, hell I thought that myself for a minute."

"Wow." Said Percy.

"Yeah. So it doesn't take long for the goons to figure out that the docking bay _isn't_ flooding --- someone had just triggered the big watertight bulkhead to close to fuck with them. The goons weren't much less panicked at that though, because half their muscle and their commander were now separated from them by two feet of air-tight steel doors.

"I wasn't going to miss this wonderful opportunity of confusion --- I dumped whatever I could find laying around on the dock down into the _Gnat_, buttoned the boat up, and took off right then. Ran on battery as far as I could, then put the rest of the exhaust back together. Fortunately the diesel fired up no problem and I made my way here."

"Hmm." Said Hemi curiously. "Who do you suppose was willing to piss them off by closing the watertight bulkhead?"

"My guess," said Shakes, "is that it was that dock boss lady. She was the first one the Authority goons questioned, of course, and she didn't looked happy about it afterwards."

"If that's true," said Percy, "then I owe her a couple of times over now."

"It's possible you made a friend of some subtlety Captain." Said Hemi.

"That watertight bulkhead did not look like the kind of thing that was open and closed at the drop of a hat. I suspect it delayed that Authority sub leaving by a couple of hours, all told. I'm not sure I could have gotten the _Gnat_ away, presumably unnoticed, without that bit of luck."

"Which brings up another thing I wanted to ask you about Shakes," said Hemi, "that boat of yours certainly is... loud now."

"Yup! I told you I put in a new exhaust. Straight pipe, wedged right up against the hull. I also tuned it for power and made some adjustments to the gear box. The _Gnat's_ diesel now puts out far more torgue than just about any other boat of its size, I'd say. And that torque is converted to unbelievably fast prop speeds."

"And a fast prop and new exhaust mean exceptional noise." Said Hemi.

"I'd say just about the loudest sub in the water!" Said Shakes proudly. "Cept maybe some of those old coastal tug subs maybe. That was the plan, right Captain Percy? The _Gnat_ runs loud and fast intereference for the _Prospect_."

"Yes," said Percy, "though I was sort of expecting we could make the _Gnat_ sound like another big submarine, not an ocean liner."

"The louder the better, I figured." Said Shakes. "Oh! I almost forgot: the other modification I made to the _Gnat_. I got a pigeon."

"A pigeon?" Asked Hemi. "I've never heard of that. Is it some new kind of sonar unit?"

"No no, like an _actual_ pigeon. A homing pigeon. Goes by the name of Herschel."

"Oh, so you got a pet..." said Percy, "to keep you company during those long hours alone aboard the _Gnat_. To keep you from going crazy... er?"

"Naw, Herschel's not a pet, I told ya --- he's an upgrade to the _Gnat_! See I got him from a guy on the dock. He's specially trained to look for his home roost on a submarine on the surface of the ocean. His roost is on the _Gnat_ now, and I've been taking care of him. Soon he'll realize the _Gnat_ is his home. Then I just give him to you guys, and when you need me, you can send Herschel out to find the _Gnat_ with a message tied to his leg."

"Umm. Why would we use a pigeon instead of, say, the radio?"

"Well, I realized that with the modifications I made to the engine, the _Gnat_ is now so loud inside that I can't hear the radio while the diesel is running. I needed another way to communicate with you guys and Herschel seemed perfect. Messages by pigeon are also more secure than radio."

"A pigeon..." said Percy skeptically.

"But if you have the _Gnat's_ hatch closed, how will you know when Herschel has returned to you?" Asked Hemi. "It's not like you'll be able to hear him tapping on the hatch with his beak..."

"An astute question my large friend, I don't want to leave the hatch open all the time. I'm going to add a small hatch in the sail --- a hole just big enough for a pigeon. When Herschel has a message for me, he can just come in through his hatch. I only need Herscel when I'm running on the surface with the loud diesels, underwater we can just use ship-to-ship and I can keep Herschel's hatch closed. 

Hemi grinned. "That's great Shakes. I cannot wait to meet Herschel. I volunteer to take responsibility for him while he's on board the _Prospect_. And I'll ask Chips to help you with your pigeon hatch."

"This seems ridiculous to me." Said Percy.

"Sylvia, this pigeon goes a long way towards addressing the problem we had with communicating with Shakes. You asked me to talk with him about that, and here's an answer... maybe not a great answer, but I think Herschel could work. If we can figure out how we can launch him from the _Prospect_ while we're submerged, he'd be a perfect communication medium...." Hemi trailed off envisioning some kind of pigeon bouy.

Captain Percy rolled her eyes. "Whatever. Don't say I'm a captain who isn't willing to give new technology a try. We'll take the pigeon aboard as our eighth crew member on a trial basis. Hey Shakes, how about a meal?"

"Absolutely." Said Shakes.


### They eat a meal; salmon can conversation

Percy called Gregory down from the control room and sent Owen up to relieve him. Gregory fired up the range and soon had canned salmon simmering in a slightly sweet dark sauce with bits of ginger in it. He put a big pot of rice on to steam.

"That smells astonishing Gregory." Shakes said. "I eat that canned salmon all the time when I'm alone on the _Gnat_ --- usually just cold and straight from the can though."

"That's... pretty foul Shakes." Said Gregory from the range, stirring his bits of fish around.

"You know, I always wondered why those salmon cans are tapered like that. Why don't they just run straight down, like all the other cans?"

"Actually, now that you mention it Shakes, I always thought that was weird myself. There has to be three-hundred cans in the galley, and all of them are perfect cylinders except for the salmon."

"I wish all cans were tapered." Said Shakes. "Sometimes I knock a stack of cans over on the _Gnat_ and the regular ones will run off under some piece of equipment. I'm pretty sure there's some cans in the bottom of the boat that rolled there years ago and I never saw again. But the taper on the salmon cans makes 'em roll around in a tight circle. They stay roughly where they fall no matter what the boat is doing and I can pick them right up."

"Maybe salmon manufacturers know mariners and submariners have a lot of salmon on board, and they shape them like that so our seagoing friends don't lose their precious cans in the corners of ships."

Hemi chuckled. "It's a nice idea. But if you want to know the real reason, it's because the salmon canneries are all in remote parts of the north. The cans are shipped up there empty to be filled with fresh-caught northern salmon. The tapered cans let them stack far more cans into the hold of ships moving the cans by nesting them."

"Oh." Said Shakes, seeming somewhat disappointed.

In another twenty minutes or so Gregory had steaming piles of rice on their plates smothered in bits of fish and ginger. He stir fried a couple of boxes of frozen spinach and scooped them onto their plates to supplement the black and white food with some dark green.

Percy called the rest of the crew in to eat in rotations that kept someone in the control room and listening to sonar. Shakes, as usual, ate twice again as much as anyone else. 

"Sweet Jesus." He said. "If you keep feeding me food I want to eat instead of forcing myself to eat cold shit from cans, I'm going to get fat." He reclined in his chair and closed his eyes.

"Nothing stopping you from equiping your boat with a hot plate Shakes." Said Gregory.

Shakes waved his hand in Gregory's lazily without opening his eyes.

"Shakes, when you regain yourself from your crapulence," said Hemi, "join me at the navigation station. I want to make sure you understand our plan for this run."

Shakes nodded sleepily as Hemi and Percy headed up to the navigation and sonar compartment.

"It's probably time for more coffee." Said Gregory reaching for the pot with the dregs of the previous batch slowly embalming a permenent stain on the bottom.


### Planning the run with Shakes

Shakes joined Hemi and Percy at the navigation table, somewhat revived by Gregory's coffee, and carrying two more tin mugs filled with coffee for Hemi and Percy. They received them gratefully.

"Here's what we're thinking Shakes." Said Captain Percy. "We're well into Consolidated States' waters now. I think trouble from them is unlikely."

Shakes nodded.

Percy placed a steel straight-edge dappled with rust patches down on the chart showing their proposed course. "Barring any unforeseen distractions, this is our planned course. We will be heading into an area that a number of Territorial Authorities claim control over."

Shakes reached into his denim vest and withdrew a small pencil and a notebook covered with black and smudged fingerprints. He began to scratch down notes in a fast, unreadable scribble.

"That's unfortunate, but unavoidable since we're heading for the mainland port of Pylon City." Said Percy.

"...The locals don't call it that." Put in Hemi.

Percy waved him off. "We estimate it will take three or four days and nights to get there. That's running slow and deep during the day, and fast on the surface at night with all things nominal."

"And what's the plan for the _Gnat_?" Shakes asked.

"Generally, we'll have you run on the surface during the day. You can shut down the diesel maybe once an hour or so, and we'll check in on ship-to-ship."

"That will also give us a chance to listen for any contacts without being swamped out by the noise of your boat." Added Hemi.

"At night, the _Gnat_ is less useful as a decoy, since the _Prospect_ will be on the surface anyway. I think you can mate up the _Gnat_ and get some sleep and a meal aboard the _Prospect_ --- at least for a few hours each night."

Shakes grinned at the thought of hot meals. "What happens if someone comes up on us in the night?"

"Well, we'll emergency dive to periscope depth, drag you out of your bunk and throw you into your boat, and make sure the _Gnat_ is off before we do a further evasive deep dive."

"OK, just remember if you take the _Gnat_ down with you, I'll have nothing but a crushed beer can for a boat." He scribbled a few notes. "What about sub with the ram and those guys who were after you? What if they are still following you?"

"I figure since we're well into another Authority's territory now, it's unlikely they are still coming after us. It's one thing to raid a depot just on the other side an Authority line. It's another to pursue an unarmed transport sub across the middle of another Authority's area of control. Having said that, did you get any sense while you were at the depot that they knew our destination?"

"I have no idea." Said Shakes. "It entirely depends on who they talked to while they were up on the exchange level. I didn't get to observe any of that."

Percy nodded.

"What about Herschel?" Asked Hemi. "When will he be ready to come aboard the _Prospect_? The _Gnat_ could potentially be a long way off pretty quickly if we come across someone who you then lead away from the _Prospect's_ location. It would be nice to have Herschel ready to go find you, in a case like that."

"Is that what you are really thinking Hemi?" Percy asked. "Or are you just looking forward to having a fluffy new crew member to take care of?"

"I'm hoping Herschel is acclimated to the _Gnat_ in another day or two. Then we can move him about the _Prospect_." Said Shakes.

"Alright," said Percy, "move the pigeon over whenever you are ready Shakes. Right now let's get the _Gnat_ running up on the surface, and get the _Prospect_ further down. I don't like being this shallow during the day."

Shakes stopped by the galley to take a refill of coffee with him, and disappeared into the bowels of the _Prospect_ and back aboard the _Gnat_. He got the _Gnat_ off and surfaced while the _Prospect_ dove down to 100 meters where Percy was more comfortable with the cover of ocean above her.

The rest of the day went as planned. The _Prospect_ moved slowly and silently through the deep, while the _Gnat_ ran just at the surface with it's diesel emitting a long belch of exhaust into the clear ocean air. Shakes had to keep the throttle back on the _Gnat_ to keep pace with the much slower _Prospect_, and at the slower speed the _Gnat_ wasn't overwhelmingly loud, about the same as an average surface transport ship. That was to their benefit because Authority enforcement craft were less likely to pursed a target that seemed like a surface transport ship --- at least during the day --- since anything on the surface was likely to be moving with the full blessing of the Authority.

Shakes shut down the _Gnat's_ diesel once every hour or so, and checked in over the ship-to-ship. He had nothing to report but clear weather, modest swells, and open ocean. A white ball of sun pushed its way slowly across a flat white sky. The two boats droned their way across the curve of the globe, and the only thing that changed was the sun slow fall to the horizon. Shakes had the hatch of the _Gnat_ open and he watched the sun swell up all orange and bloated, like it was going to expel a flatulent burst of world-ending fire over the surface of the planet before it was snuffed out by the force of night pressing down on it.

The dark spread slowly from behind, catching up to and overtaking the _Gnat_. When it did, Captain Percy brought the _Prospect_ up to the surface and they began their night crew rotations with someone always on the radar and someone always in the lookout ring. A thin quickblade of a moon climbed up behind a thick, oppressive haze, its sharp points dulled as if they had been poked one too many times through a heavy fabric. 

Shakes ran the _Gnat_ off at some distance for the first half of the night, and then dove and brought the boat under to mate with the _Prospect_, which slowed the _Prospect's_ speed, but Percy figured this was worth it to keep Shakes alert and relatively sane during the day. He came on board and ate a couple of large bowls of a hot brown soup Gregory had left simmering on the range, accompanied by thick slices of a stale and grainy bread which he would cover in butter and soak in the soup until each bite softened. He slept for a few hours in one of the _Prospect's_ comfortable racks. As the sky lightened in the east, Captain Percy woke him and told him it was time to get the _Gnat_ off.

Shakes stumbled to the galley to pick up his morning coffee. There he found Hemi who accompanied him down to the open hatch to the _Gnat_. Shakes disappeared down through the hatch and returned holding a small wire cage with a splotchy gray bird. Herschel was sleek and trim, with an unmistakeable intelligence to the eyes.

"Hemi meet Herschel." Said Shakes holding the cage up for Hemi to take while he climbed up out of the _Gnat_.

Hemi poked a thick finger between the bars and rubbed Herschel's head gently. "Shakes this bird looks smarter than you."

"Maybe you should hire him to drive the _Gnat_ for you." Said Shakes.

"This cage seems really small."

"That's just his travel cage. I have a nice comfy roost installed for him down in the _Gnat_. You don't want him to forget where his home is, otherwise he won't return there when you release him."

"Can I let him out of this cage?"

"Sure, if you --- or Percy --- don't mind a little pigeon shit around."

"I believe I shall give this fellow the run of the boat."

Shakes handed Hemi a small leather case with tiny papers and a steel band. "This is his leg band. It's pretty self-explanatory. Just write your message, attach it, and toss Herschel in the air. He'll find the _Gnat_ if it's anywhere within maybe a hundred miles or so."

"How do we get him _back_ though?" Asked Hemi.

"Well..." Said Shake scratching his grimy neck with black fingernails. "It's kinda a one-way thing. I have to give him back to you in person. We might be able to get him to fly over to the _Prospect_ from the _Gnat_ if you were within sight... and maybe he knew you had some food."

"I understand. It's a 'homing' pigeon. It only goes home."

"Right."

"Well, welcome aboard Herschel. Shakes, have a good run today."

"I expect to, though I'll miss having my copilot with me."


### Shakes leads off the sub with the ram 

The _Gnat_ was off and the _Prospect_ submerged and running at depth before the first molten blob of malevolent red sun percolated up on the horizon. Shakes was running the _Gnat_ hot and loud. He was standing up in the pilot's chair with head head above the hatch in the wind, trying to blow the bleary sleep out of his eyes. He sucked on a cigarette, but the wind was making the coal on the end glow like the sun coming up on the horizon behind him. His cigarette was disappearing fast. A long shadow of the short sail of the _Gnat_ with his round head on top stretched out in front of him on the slate-gray water.

One hundred meters below him in the _Prospect_ it was nearly silent as the crew eased into their more relaxed daytime shifts. Captain Percy was in the control room smoking with Bastian, and Cassandra had just woken when the boat dove, and was making her way with a coffee to the sonar station for the long day watch.

The first few hours passed with dull regularity. Shakes had nothing to report during diesel stops, and by her third cigarillo Percy was settling into the comfortable state of mind-blanking boredom that she was her most familiar association with life aboard submarines.

By mid-morning, Shakes was shutting the diesel of the _Gnat_ down for the third time. 

Cassandra could heard the _Gnat's_ diesel putter away to a halt --- leaving a silent relief in her headphones that she blessed. As usual, she called up to the control room to let them know the _Gnat_ was shut down for a listening and check-in session. "Captain Percy, the _Gnat_ just went silent."

"Alright. Thanks Cassandra." Percy called back down to her. Percy took down the ship-to-ship mic. "Shakes --- the usual: how're things looking up there?"

"Well, for lack of anything else to report, I'll tell you that the weather is thickening up a bit. The haze has really set in, and there's a bit of a chop coming on. Nothing to mention right now, but it looks to me like the kind of things that could turn into real weather later."

Weather was not generally a concern for Percy, submarines could ride out even the worst weather at depth. But she couldn't guess at what the _Gnat_ could handle. "Does that give you anything to worry about with the _Gnat_?"

"Naw." Shakes voice crackled. "The _Gnat's_ been through the very worst. If it gets bad, I'll dive and ride it out underwater. With all this running on the surface, the batteries are always fully topped-up."

Knowing the _Gnat_ couldn't dive very deep at all, Percy was unconvinced that this was a solution to big weather, but she also knew Shakes had taken the _Gnat_ back and forth across deep ocean many times. She decided to trust his experience. "Alright then Shakes. If you..."

"Captain Percy!" Cassandra interrupted with a shout from sonar. "I think I've got a contact."

"Hold on Shakes. We might have a contact. Don't start your diesel." Percy hung up the mic and slid down the ladder.

Cassandra had her eyes closed and was concentrating intently on the sounds in her headset. She had the mics pointed towards the _Prospect's_ hard rear starboard quarter, and the strength indicator gauge was nodding weakly just a bit above the pin. "It feels like I'm only on the edge of the signal. They might be directly behind us."

"Bastian," Percy called up to him, "throttle down. Stop the prop, Cassandra needs to hear what's behind us."

A moment later the perennial resonance of the electric motor died away. Cassandra brought the sonar mics back to face the dead stern of the boat. The signal strength indicator immediately shot up to a definite contact. "Absolutely Captain Percy. I can hear the engine in the water. Sounds like another diesel."

Percy looked at the signal strength dial and knew immediately that the contact had snack in under the sound of the _Gnat's_ diesel when it was running, and then a bit closer even by being dead astern of them where Cassandra couldn't hear very well over the sound of their own prop turning. The contact was probably far closer than Percy was comfortable with now --- maybe twenty nautical miles. "Fuck." Was all she said.

She climbed up to the control room and got Shakes back on the ship-to-ship. "Defintely a contact Shakes. Now it's your turn. Fire up the _Gnat_ and see if you can lead them off and away from us. Let's see if this scheme of ours works!"

"Abso-fucking-lutely! Motherfuck..." The end of his oath was cut off by the whining start of the _Gnat's_ diesel engine which came blaring over the ship-to-ship radio for a moment before Shakes took his thumb off the transmit button.

Percy flipped on the red night-lighting. "Bastian --- don't move the boat. Don't trim anything or let her make any sounds."

"Dead silent drift, got it Captain." Said Bastian.

Percy slid down to the sonar compartment and tapped Cassandra on the shoulder. "Stay on them both Cassandra. I'm going to wake Hemi." Percy disappeared down the ladder to crew quarters and returned a minute later with Hemi's big form following her up from below. He was still pulling on his tweed jacket and fixing his spectacles while he sat at the sonar station and put on the second headset.

Cassandra looked at him, and pointed at the signal strength gauge and the bearing without saying anything. Hemi nodded while listening intently.

After a minute, Percy broke the silence. "Well, Hemi... is that our creepy sub with the ram?"

Hemi sighed. "It is. Absolutely. The ram gives it a distinctive hull noise."

"Fuck!" Said Percy. "So much for the theory that they wouldn't follow us this far into another Authority's territory."

"For all we know," said Hemi, "this is their area, and they were crossing someone else's line earlier to find us."

"But," protested Percy, "that's totally fucking irrational --- we didn't have a job or plan until we got to the depot. We didn't know what we would be hauling, so how does it make any sense that an Authority boat would be after us when we have no job and an empty hold?"

"They aren't acting rationally." Said Hemi. "They are acting like they have a grudge."

"Ah fuck. It doesn't fucking matter --- what matters is our current situation. Next order of business you two: are they following Shakes away from us."

Hemi took over the sonar directional control wheel from Cassandra and made some slight adjustments to center the signal. He flipped some switches to engage filters, and a moment later switched them off again. "You see Cassandra," he explained, "with these filters engaged I can better hear the _Gnat_ and with them disengaged it's easier to focus on the pursuing sub."

She nodded.

After a few minutes of listening Hemi reported to Percy: "it... seems like it's working Syl. The sub with the ram is definitely following Shakes. And..." He paused for a moment to listen, "Shakes seems to be able to stay well ahead of them." He pointed to the mic directional indicator. "They are already 10 degrees off our course, and moving away quickly."

"That's fucking excellent Hemi." Percy Said.

"Can't they like, shoot at Shakes or something?" Asked Cassandra.

"It's very difficult to hit such a small fast-moving target as the _Gnat_ with a torpedo. Though the _Gnat's_ engine is so loud that it's doubtful Shakes would hear an incoming torpedo. Hopefully he's smart enough to make random course changes every 5 miles or so to make aiming a torpedo more challenging..." Hemi looked doubtful.

"Well keep on them." Said Percy. "Let me know if anything changes, or what the final result is." She stuck a cigarillo between her lips and started climbing the ladder to the control room.

"OK Captain Percy." Said Cassandra.

"Cassandra, keep tracking them." Said Hemi. He stood up, still wearing the sonar headset, and leaned over the navigation table. He measured the angle of the bearing to the contacts off their current position marked on the chart, and then drew a line marking Shakes and the pursuing sub's course. By listening carefully to what the sonar was picking up in his headset he estimated their distanced away. 

He and Cassandra tracked the two sound sources like this for over an hour. Then he stood to his full height and stretched. He took off the headset and hung it on the peg, and patted Cassandra on the shoulder before climbing up to the control room to talk to Percy.

"Shakes and the sub with the ram are far out and moving out of range. I can no longer estimate distance on the sonar." Said Hemi.

"What's the end-game in this maneuver for Shakes?" Asked Percy. "He can't just run forever."

"Well, hopefully the pursuing sub realizes they are on the wrong target at a good distance away from us. They will likely leave off chasing Shakes and turn around to try to reacquire us here where they lost us. We will, of course, be long gone by then."

"So now it's time for a course change."

"Indeed."

"And how do we find Shakes again? You think you can raise him with that pigeon?"

"I think Herschel will be just as good, if not better option than trying to get him on the radio. To get Shakes on the radio, we both have to be on the surface at the same time, and he has to have his diesel off. Not to mention the radio could be monitored. I believe Herschel is as good an option as any."

"OK. We'll surface tonight, and you can send the pigeon out after Shakes then."

Cassandra kept listening to the sonar for another half hour, occasionally reporting that she thought she could still hear them when the conditions were favorable. At that point Percy decided it was time to leave, and had Bastian throttle the electric motor up to 15 knots. They quickly motored off on a southerly course that Percy randomly selected to move them away from the area.

The rest of the hours of the day ticked by with nothing to break the monotony and no changes to make other than occasional minor adjustments to the trim of the boat. Whereas earlier Cassandra had been cursing the noise of the _Gnat's_ engine polluting the water, now she found she missed it. Somehow it had been comforting to know Shakes was up there on the surface. Not to mention that his hourly check-ins were at least a way to mark time and shift her attention. Now they were down in this dark cold pit of water, blind and alone, and it began to feel like they were doomed to remain like this until the end of their days. 


### they hear the storm above, decide whether to surface

Cassandra's eyes were bleary and drooping as she stared blankly at the sonar console 10 hours later. Captain Percy and Hemi were having a discussion behind her in the sonar compartment about whether it was time to surface and begin their nighttime run.

"How's the charge on the batteries Hemi?" Percy asked.

"OK, but getting low. We're at maybe 10 percent capacity."

"So, we could stay under maybe another 4 or 5 hours at a creep."

"Yes. We took a big chunk out of the batteries by leaving the area we contacted the sub with the ram at such a high speed."

"I know, but strategically, putting on some distance was the right thing to do."

"I don't disagree." Said Hemi.

"So when should we surface? We definitely want to run the diesels and put a charge back on the batteries, but it opens us up as a radar contact for those fuckers following us. They could easily be within range to detect us on radar."

"And if they do, the whole move with Shakes would be wasted."

"Right. So, do you got a recommendation for me?" Percy asked.

Hemi turned to Cassandra and tapped her on the shoulder. "Any contacts on sonar Cassandra?"

She pulled back a headphone. "Nothing... mechanical. But the background noise of the ocean has changed Hemi. It sounds... weird."

"Hmm." Hemi picked up the other headset and made some adjustments. He listened for a moment and pulled the headset off. "Well, that complicates things. Seems like we drove right into that storm Shakes was predicting."

"Fuck." Said Percy.

"Ohhh..." said Cassandra to herself, "so that's what a churned up surface sounds like." She filed away in her mind another almost-magical aspect of sonar. "But I don't feel any storm affecting the _Prospect_ Hemi?"

"Even bad storms don't stir the water this deep."

"On the surface though," said Percy, "it's another matter."

"...I hope Shakes is alright." Cassandra muttered a little blessing for his well-being.

"How bad is it Hemi?" Percy asked.

"Pretty bad. Sounds like there could be 10 meter waves up there."

"That's the kind of weather we're better off staying under."

"My recommendation now is that we stay under while we still have battery left." Said Hemi.

"Normally, that's the move, of course. But we need to be thinking ahead as well: staying down now could force us to the surface in daylight with no charge at all on the battery. We could end up a helpless target. If we go up now we can get the batteries charged up with very little chance of being found."

"Running on the surface in the storm does provide a lot of cover, the radar will be swamped and the ocean makes enough noise to cover our running diesels... But it could also swamp us or crack the _Prospect's_ spine."

"She's a strong boat Hemi, and with good pilots I think she can handle it. Let's prep to surface."


### they surface in a storm

Hemi and Captain Percy climbed up to the control room. Bastian and Owen were in the control seats watching the unmoving gauges with bored and sleepy eyes.

"We're going to surface." Said Hemi. "And there's a pretty serious blow up there. Owen, I'm going to sit in that plane control chair. I need you to go down to the navigation/sonar compartment and get ready to blow the main ballast tanks."

Owen stood and Hemi slipped his bulky form around him and down into the small boat control chair.

"You're going to do an emergency blow?" Owen asked, surprised.

"Not a full blow, on my signal I just want you to open the high pressure air into the main ballast for a few seconds. I want to pop the boat up onto the surface. If we use the normal low-pressure system to ease up, there's too much of a chance for the intakes to be swamped in these seas. You all understand the procedure."

Owen and Bastian nodded. Owen slipped down the ladder to the sonar compartment and they could hear him opening the toolbox that held the emergency blow wrench.

"OK Bastian, give us a little more throttle. I'm adjusting the planes for some up-angle."

The bow of the boat rose slowly ahead of them, and Percy, being the only one standing, leaned into the angle. She found her pack of cigarillos tucked into the wall, and pulled one out to light it. Bastian slipped a cigarette from his shirt pocket and lit it off Percy's coal.

"Hemi, Another degree on the bow, I think." Said Percy.

Hemi turned the plane control wheel slightly, and the boat eased to a somewhat steeper angle. "I'm going to come level at just about 10 meters, then we'll have Owen blow air into the main ballast tanks." He said. He made some small adjustments on the trim tank control panel so the boat didn't have to put quite so much energy into lifting the bow.

Hemi kept his eyes locked on the depth gauge, watching it crawl slowly back around towards zero and the boat rose. Just as it passed the 10 meter mark, Hemi turned the plane control wheel and the bow of the boat eased down to level. At this shallower depth, the boat took on the motion from the waves on the surface, slowly listing from one side to the other by 10 degrees or so. "OK!" Hemi yelled down to Owen. "Open the air into the main ballast Owen!"

Percy punched the emergency blow alarm, to be sure everyone on the boat was aware they were performing a dangerous maneuver.

From below they heard the squeak of the turning valve, and a loud hiss. Air rushed through the pipes below them and down into the ballast. Hemi started counting to himself. There was a pause where nothing happened and then they all felt the upward acceleration of the _Prospect_ lifting them.

Hemi's count hit 5. "Close it down Owen!"

The hiss stopped, but the upward motion did not. Percy wrapped her fingers in the leather strap hanging over her head. They rode the force of the expanding air upwards for a few seconds and then the boat went weightless for a second as it reached the surface. They could feel their stomachs rise within them, and Hemi and Bastian's knuckles went white gripping their control wheels.

The depth gauge landed firmly on its zero pin and sat there. The boat rolled slowly with the surface swell.


### The Prospect rolls over

All of these movements were well beyond the everyday range of motion for the _Prospect_, which typically experienced little more than a gentle roll in the course of a normal day of travel. But Captain Percy knew her boat very well after all these years. Even during a dramatic maneuver like blowing out the main ballast tanks she knew the boat was well within its capabilities. Hemi and Bastian might have nervous looks on their faces, but Percy gripped her strap and casually smoked her cigarillo as they took the express route to the surface.

When the boat bobbed back downwards and began to settle on the surface, she was about to raise the periscope and have Chips prime the diesels for starting when she suddenly felt the deck below her feet move in a way that she was not expecting.

It was nothing very dramatic, just a slight roll and yaw that Percy's whole being knew simply wasn't right. If the _Prospect_ was a haptic extension of Percy's own body, this was like she had just tripped over her own feet. While she had no worries during the rise to the surface, this sudden strange motion of the boat made her break out in a cold sweat. Nobody else seemed to even notice it though.

"Hemi... something's wrong." She said, but even the time it took to get the words out had been too long of a delay. A second motion that was far more dramatic had begun. She punched the collision alarm and the klaxon sounded to the lowest depths of the boat.

The _Prospect_ started to list to the starboard side. It was the motion of some skyscraping giant lifting them closer to his near-sighted eyes for inspection without regard for the orientation of the strange object in his hand. The giant was, in fact, a huge wave.

The _Prospect_ rolled hard over to starboard, and it did not stop rolling.

"Fuck Hemi! You brought us up in the ditch of a wave! We're fucking going over!"

The port wall became the ceiling. The boat was rolled over 90 degrees on its side by being caught in the wrong part of a huge wave. It kept rolling even past 90 degrees. Captain Percy crashed into the starboard wall. Hemi put one arm out to brace himself, and the other arm against Bastian to brace him. Hemi's enormous strength rippled through his body and held the two men firmly in place at their control stations, defying gravity. Throughout the boat the was the sound of the shifting crash of carefully secured objects falling hard against the starboard side that formed the new down.

As on all submarines, the crew generally kept objects secured by strap or rail against the roll of the ship. Both to keep things from falling out of place with the normal motion of the boat, and to prevent a falling object from potentially making enough noise to give their position away on sonar. But objects were secured against maybe a 20 degree roll, not a 90 degree roll. At that angle nearly everything in the boat found itself yanked free by malevolent gravity.

The lights blinked a few times and then shorted out as bilge water made its way to places it did not belong. A few moments later the control room and sonar compartment were lit with the harsh white glare of the battery-backup emergency floodlights.

From the sonar compartment, Cassandra screamed. "Holy shit. Holy shit. Holt shit. Is this it? Are we going down?" She shrieked.

Hemi responded to her with forceful strain, "Cassandra. Don't panic. Submarines are designed with all the weight at their bottoms. They always come upright eventually."

"Except when they don't." Said Bastian, but only loud enough for Hemi to hear.

"Hemi." Said Percy flatly to him. "What about the cargo?"

"Let's put our trust in the packing material." He said. "If one of them does explode, we'll know it immediately, and a few seconds after that, it won't matter."

Bastian coughed.

"We could open the main ballast valves, try to submerge again." Suggested Hemi.

"I'd be too worried about the tanks flooding unevenly. We could end up turning turtle." Said Percy. "I think we need to ride it out. She'll come up again..."

The boat rocked on it's side for minutes on end, sometimes rolling in a way that felt like they would go upside down. Occasionally the lights would flicker, but continually shorted out. They listened to the ongoing sounds of the boat's stores crashing and sliding through all the compartments.

Hemi began to doubt his own words. Maybe this was one of those times that the boat was not going to come back upright. And even if it did, coming upright could always be the thing that set off one of the magnetic mines. Cassandra had been reduced to whimpering on the deck below them, though they could hear the Owen had made his way over to her and was telling her things in a low voice they couldn't hear but clearly had a reassuring tone. Bastian just kept saying "fuck!" every few seconds, with more and more frustration.

Captain Percy lay against the starboard wall. She spat, and her long experience of it arcing to the deck was defied by gravity which pulled it back against the side of the ship.

But as she was the first to feel the boat go wrong, Captain Percy was also the first to feel it begin to right itself. There was the slightest relaxing of the angle, she could feel a tiny bit more pressure from the floor through her boots. The _Prospect_ was telling her it was coming back up.

At first it was just a slow rotation, but then it gathered speed and soon the control room was whipped up into the air, and then came back again as the _Prospect_ found it's upright footing.


### Hemi gets them straightened out; confrontation with Chips

"Fuck!" Bastian said. "Now what?"

"Forward throttle Bastian!" Said Percy. "Do the motors have power?"

From far below decks came the increasing hum of the motors spinning the props.

"Motors have power, Cap." Said Bastian.

"Small favors." Said Percy to herself. "OK Bastian, pick a bearing and keep us moving on it. Hemi! Get up on the bridge --- with a lifeline --- and get us steering into the waves so we don't roll over in the ditch again."

"You don't want to dive?" Hemi asked.

"Not without regular power through the boat." Percy said.

Hemi nodded, and slipped down the to the lower decks to go after gear he needed.

Percy grabbed at the boat PA mic and thumbed the transmitter, but there was no power to any of the radios. She leaned over the hatch to the sonar compartment. "Owen! Go find Chips and help her get the power back on."

"Right Percy." Owen headed off quickly, nearly running into Gregory who was stumbling up from crew quarters.

"You alright Gregory?" Percy asked.

"Yah, I fucking fell out of the rack when we rolled, but I'm OK."

"Good. Go down to the cargo hold and check the cargo --- make sure nothing's about to explode on us, and get it re-stowed, OK?"

"Yah, I'm on it." Gregory pushed his way forward through the compartment against the rocking of the boat. Now that it was on the surface, it was clearly taking a beating from the weather.

Hemi returned wearing a full-length rubber foul-weather slicked and carrying a coil of heavy rope over his arm.

"We won't be able to see much up there Syl. We need to rig some floodlights."

"I know, but we can't do that without power. Just do your best to feel your way out of the ditch. As soon as the power comes on, we'll send some clamp-lights up."

Hemi opened the hatch at the top of the control room, and wind immediately whipped into the boat, driving rain with it. Hemi climbed up and tied the heavy line around himself and hitched it to secure rings behind the fairing of the bridge. The topside world was an environment of blackness pressing against blackness. Hemi was surrounded by huge moving mountains of dark, rolling upwards and trying to touch the black sky that hung just over them, pressing down. 

"OK Bastian!" Hemi shouted down to the control room. "Left-rudder, three degrees."

Bastian shouted the order back up to Hemi, repeating it like the pilot of a military ship would, knowing that Hemi had to be sure he was doing as he was asked.

"I think you can start the diesels Percy." Hemi shouted down a moment later.

She stepped up behind Bastian to the engine control panel and flipped on the power to the diesels. The panels lit up, so she pushed and held the start buttons until she heard the diesels firing below her feet.

"A little more throttle Bastian!" Hemi called down after the diesels started bellowing their reassuring exhaust behind him. Now he felt like the _Prospect_ had the power to confront this big weather.

A few minutes later the lights came back on, and power started flowing through all the parts of the ship.

Percy picked up the PA mic. "Nice work Chips." She waited a second but there was no reply over the ship PA. "Bastian, I'm going to the cargo hold to check on the load."

The ship was a mess. Percy made her way stepping over all the detritus of a working sub scattered all over every floor: tools, bedding, cans of food, cleaning supplies, scattered stacks of papers, half-unrolled charts, pencils, rags, parts, and equipment. For all the mess in the main decks though, the cargo hold wasn't too bad. Hemi's careful re-arrangement of the cargo crates earlier hand included strapping the crates against the wall, and the old cotton-web straps had mostly held. Only a couple of crates had broken loose. Gregory was using the block and tackle to move them out of the center area of the cargo hold. Chips had joined him, and was stowing equipment that had been shaken loose. She had one of the broken bicycles that had escaped from the rusty bicycle pile in her hands when she saw Percy.

Chips's face immediately went red. "That's the second fucking time Percy. Two fucking times you almost fucking killed me now. You fucking surfaced the boat in a fucking storm? Fucking damn you to a cold fucking watery hell you fucking shit-faced twat."

"Fuck you Chips! I'm the fucking captain of this boat. I have to make these calls. They aren't always going to be perfect or safe."

"But with a fucking load of fucking explosives? You fucking ride out bad fucking storms submerged. Every stupid fucking green boat driver knows that. But apparently, you fucking think it's fine to surface with a hold full of TNT. We were a fucking mite's-dick away from being blown to the bottom of the fucking hole!"

Percy leveled her emotions. "I don't fucking need this right now. I have bigger problems than you. Go cool the fuck down Chips." Percy turned and walked away.

Chips threw the rusted bicycle frame into the corner with the other bicycles. The hollow tubes of thin steel crashed together.


### They drive through the storm

With the power restored, Captain Percy tracked down some powerful floodlights in the storage hold. They were designed to be clamped onto the fairing of the sail for situations like this, where visibility was nearly nothing, but the boat still needed to be piloted visually from the top of the sail. Powering them required running heavy weather-proof electrical cables up from the control room to the bridge. 

She called for Owen to come help her on the PA. Together they managed to get the heavy lights through the control room and up to the bridge of the sail. In the slashing rain Percy held each of the four lights in place while Owen clamped the lights onto the fairing by bolts tightened with a wet and slipping wrench. Owen draped the cables down through the sail and into the control room where he connected them to high-amperage power sockets.

Hemi had been mostly guessing from which way the big waves were at him, and having Bastian adjust the course to to keep them moving laterally across the trough of the waves, where they faced the most risk of rolling over again. Now he had the floodlights on he could actually see the black throbbing landscape around him. Huge mountains, the color of crude, slipped towards him and under the boat, lifting it high up among the spindrift blowing white from their peaks.

Hemi tried to spot the big ones coming at him from a couple of waves away. WHen he saw one, he would have Bastian steer into them, driving up their sides splitting through the top and crashing down into the valley below. The wind blew without relent, carrying a mix of rain and blown water from which no distinction could be made whether it was moving upwards or downwards.

The powerful lights pushed back the darkness only to reveal a landscape of blackness stretching out in front of Hemi. To the uninitiated it was a hellscape, an unstable surface on an alien world. Any ship in weather like this was a tiny figure on a vast plane, roamed by monsters the size of apartment buildings that arrived with stealth, and an ability and intent to crush even the most formidable intruders and drive them down into the bottomless hole they strode over.

But Hemi felt no fear as long as the hum of the diesels shoot his boots, and the heat of the exhaust bellowed from the pipes behind him. He had been through weather like this many times over the years and knew a well-found ship with a strong engine should have no trouble. As old as the boat was, he had all faith in the _Prospect_. The storm could try its evil best to do them down, but Hemi wasn't going to go without a fight.

After an hour of charging into the storm Hemi was starting to feel it though. Hemi was not a loud man and his voice was already cracking from shouting directives down to the control room. It also took an enormous amount of energy to keep his concentration focussed on the nearly-featureless black seascape. Wild as it was, it became debilitatingly ugly and repetitive in a short time. It also took physical stamina just to stay standing on the bridge against the wind and roll of the boat. The most distressing thing to Hemi though was that he had only been at this for an hour. There was a chance they could be running through this storm until dawn, something like 10 hours away.

Gregory, dressed in a black foul-weather slicker that covered him from crown to calf's, and heavy rain boots, climbed up through the sail to join Hemi on the bridge. 

"Percy sent me up." Gregory shouted to Hemi through the wind. "She wants me in the lookout ring. Seems fucking stupid to me."

Hemi nodded. "The sour prospects of fortune are determined by the winds that blow out of hell, Gregory. I do not believe there is more to see from the lookout ring than down here on the bridge. Still, I'll be glad to have help spotting incoming big ones... and someone to witness my end if I get blown overboard."

"Maybe that's the real reason she wanted me up here!" Gregory grinned at Hemi as the rain soaked his face.

Gregory clipped on a lifeline and climbed up to the lookout ring, his meaty hands almost glowing white where they came out from under the slicker and gripped the wet steel ladder. In the lookout ring, he doubled up his safety line. He withdrew a pair of binoculars from under his slicker, but they were nearly useless in a matter of minutes. He reverted to holding the brim of his hood down to shade his eyes, and least from the water that came down at him, little good it did against the water that rose up at him.


### Cassandra on sonar in the storm

Down in the sonar compartment Cassandra's eyes were watery and red. She had been on sonar watch for more than 12 hours. 12 hours of staring at the same screen and set of gauges, which never showed the slightest change. While she had quickly adapted to the typically very gently motion of the submarine, now it was moving like the worst kind of low-riding surface ship. It lifted her up, and dropped her down, sometimes hard enough to lift her from her chair. Unlike a surface ship, the were no windows though. There was no way for her to see any kind of horizon by which she could orient her confused inner ear. Sickness rose up in her again and again, and she kept forcing it back down. The only relief was the occasional cool, wet breeze that found its way all the way down through the open hatch in the control room to her far corner of the sonar compartment. 

She had expected to be in her rack hours ago, but Captain Percy had come by and asked her to stay on sonar. She had told Cassandra that, while it was unlikely they would meet any other vessels in a storm like this, sonar might be the only way they would know if another ship was coming at them.

So Cassandra literally hung on. She gripped the handles on either side of the sonar unit in her small hands, her fingers curling around the cold painted and chipped steel. The tension in her arms had passed from a searing ache to a dull background pain hours ago.

Cassandra closed her eyes and focused her mind on the sounds in hear headset. She left her body behind in the boat, and moved her mind out into the water. This was becoming easier and easier with practice, though overcoming the exhaustion and pain of a long shift made it somewhat more challenging.

The ocean was overwhelmed by the sounds of the storm on the surface, and the heavy drone of the diesel engines reverberating through the hull of the _Prospect_. With the diesels running up towards their max RPMs, the whole boat shook with the vibration of the grinding fuel burners. The engines provided a low frequency bass note that cut a never-varying line of deep sound through the sonar.

Above the engines in pitch was the sound of the waves. This sound was white, but unlike the drone of the diesels was constantly changing and shifting. It was a heavy sound that curled and rolled, until a wave broke. When that happened the sound would change to a rushing wall which would overtake everything until it receded a few seconds later and the drone of the engines came back up underneath.

When she concentrated, Cassandra could hear the whistle of the wind itself, pressing against the surface of the water and driving it with its vicious will.

Those sounds all combined into a heavy repetitive groan that rose and fell depending on which source was taking over at any moment. But cut across that was the sound of the motion of the boat itself. Every minute or so, the bow would break out of a wave, accompanied by a new rush of wind on the sonar mics. Then it would be followed by the crunching sound of the boat plunging back under the water, which would run out in a long stream of the sounds of water rushing along the side of the hull.

All of this came together to form something that, to Cassandra's ears, sounded like an almost spiritual music --- a drone music with variations that carried one off slightly to keep one's interest, but then always returned to a home place. The grinding roll of it all seemed like it could be an effort to raise the consciousness of someone lucky enough to be listening to a plane or a place in the mind where one could see out forever, out through thousands and thousands of miles of empty ocean, and pick out some particular particle or source, and understand what exactly its intentions were. Perhaps a sperm whale 10,000 feet down in the blackness, closing its jaws around the expelling juices of an enormous cephalopod. Or the churning roll of a machine bit boring into the ocean floor.

Cassandra let her mind sink into this strange music flowing through her headset, passing from one ear through the middle of her head to the other ear, and at the same time letting her mind wander around in the sea surrounding them. This went on for more than an hour before she was jolted back to the sonar compartment by the distraction of Captain Percy and Chips having a loud and heated argument behind her. That was unfortunate because just at that moment she believed she could hear a new sound out in the darkness. It was something faint and far off. It was something incongruous and inappropriate, like a soloist from some fast-moving secular entertainment music had been dropped on top of her spiritual drone. 

She opened her eyes and looked at her instruments. She swung the mics around towards the boat's rear starboard side. At about 160 degrees that there was a slight, but very real, wavering of the signal strength indicator. It just popped its head up for a second, like some prairie rodent checking for raptors. Cassandra spun the mic direction wheel back across the bearing, and the needle went up and down again. Back and forth she scanned, and each time the needle moved and she was sure now that she could hear a faint mechanical hum in hear earpiece when it did so.

She focused the mics on the source of the mechanical sound in the water, and listened to it. It was nothing more than a soft hum that had diffused itself across some unknown amount of the dense medium they worked in, gently tickled the sensitive membranes of the ship's mics, and then ran close to the speed of light through the ship's wiring, past the condensers and filters of her equipment, up the fading braided wires of the headset and into her ears. For all that, it was nothing but a pulpy mush of a signal, barely discernible as mechanical save for the slow cycle of rising and falling at just a few hertz, but in a evenly repetitive way that was unmistakable.

But she was struggling to figure out if the source was some distance off or if it was closer, but moving very quietly. The drone of the engines and the background noise from the surface was interfering with and confusing her sense of distance in the water. It made her feel a little like she was lost and alone on the surface, being lifted and dropped by the force of the storm. The source of the sound might be visible one second, and then she was deaf and blind under the water, and by the time she came to the surface again it had moved far off.

Captain Percy and Chip's argument grew louder. Cassandra had the sense they might be on the verge of blows. It kept pulling her back to the sonar compartment when she knew she needed her mind out there in the water. But she didn't feel like she had the authority to enforce quiet in the compartment.

She rested her elbows on the console, and cupped her hands over the metal and leather pieces of the earphones. She listened to the mechanical hum in the water, and tried to guess by the difference between her right and left ear how far they were. But the white noise of the storm washed it all into one blended continuous sound. She stared at the signal strenght indicator and dared it to move. 

And then it did. It jumped up, marked a point and floated there for half a second. It was accompanied by a rattling clink --- metal on metal somewhere out in that black expanse. A dropped piece of cutlery perhaps. The sound was distintinctive, carrying Cassandra back to her childhood, to playing on the floor of a kitchen while a meal was being prepared above her. She tried to keep the feeling of safeness that brought to her as in her earphones the sound took on an other-worldly echo. An echo that her mind processed for distance --- which brought the rising terror of how close she now knew that sound to be.

"Captain Percy! They're right on us!" She turned and yelled.

Percy immediately broke off with the red-faced Chips and stared at Cassandra, her eyes going wide. It took her a second to process what Cassandra had said. "Oh fuck. A contact?" She asked Cassandra to confirm.

"Yes!" Cassandra put all the conviction she could into it, worried that she wasn't conveying the seriousness of the situation quickly enough.

"How close?" Percy asked.

"I don't know!" Cassandra panicked. "Too close! They're _here_!" She pointed her finger at the console. "Rear left side of the ship."


### The pursuing sub rises and starts to shoot

Percy grabbed the painted steel rungs of the ladder up to the control room, feeling old paint fleck off under her fingers where she gripped the rungs excessively tightly. She flew up the ladder, cupped her hands around her mouth and yelled up to Hemi, "Contact! Rear port quarter!" She could hear Hemi repeating the information up to Gregory in the lookout ring.

Gregory made a motion to pull out the binoculars from under his slicker, but as he looked in the direction Hemi indicated, he realized he did not need them. There before him rose a shadowy leviathan, breaking out from the dropping curve of the next wave behind them. It was so dark that Gregory would have thought it was literally a leviathan: a whale or a giant squid or something, except as soon as it's huge dorsal area split the surface, two holes appeared in it's back, from which poured out red light, like the eyes of some corrupted pet of hell. The shadows of people briefly caused those eyes to blink, and Gregory knew they were moving onto the deck of the sub that was so close it looked like the next wave could drop them on top of the _Prospect_.

Gregory cupped one hand to his mouth and stretched his arm out to point in a gesture that dated back to the dawn of humans venturing out onto water. "Hemi! The Beast!"

Hemi turned and looked, and instantly knew the _Prospect's_ only course of action. "Dive!" He shouted as he pressed the dive alarm button. He looked up at Gregory in the lookout ring. "We have to dive Gregory! Get below!" The alarm sounded up to him from below in the control room and all through the depths of the boat.

Long thin fingers of flame reached out from the submarine behind them and split the darkness between them. It was followed instantly by the low, fast cracking sound of heavy automatic weapon fire and the sickening thud of lead slamming into the thick steel of the _Prospect's_ sail and ringing with a clanging echo through the hull of the ship.

Hemi immediately dropped his significant mass to the deck of the bridge, under the fairing of the sail and then lowered himself down through the interior of the sail and into the control room. He looked up through the open hatch and called loudly for Gregory.

"Were they fucking firing on us? That same fucking sub?" Percy asked, furious.

"Yes. I saw the ram." Said Hemi. "We need to dive. Now. Open the main ballast vents." But he knew his words were redundant. Owen had already shut down the diesels, and Bastian was putting an angle on the dive plane and the main ballast was flooding. The bow tilted towards the depths. But the row of lights that showed the status of the hatches contained one glaring red light among the green --- the control room hatch.

The depth gauge had already climbed off its zero pin. The deck of the _Prospect_ would be awash in a matter of seconds. The control room would be under shortly after that. Hemi looked up through the open hatch "Gregory! We're going down!" But all he could see was black rain blowing across the bridge. "He was pretty exposed up in the lookout ring when they started firing. He may have been hit." Hemi said to Percy.

They suddenly all ducked involuntarily as more shrapnel hit the sail.

Through the hatch they could hear a loud, low voice, enlarged by loudspeakers mounted to the sail of the pursuing sub, so that all enunciation blended together into one long echoing drone of command, like the voice of a dog's possessing demons that drive the vulnerable mind to murder. "Do not submerge. Disengage your motors and prepared to be boarded." 

This was followed by a long string of regional control organizations, treaty clauses, and naval ranks by which the following sub conveyed it's unshakeable and inviolable authority to issue such a command. 


### They dive; Gregory dies

"Close the hatch Hemi." Percy said.

"I... I can't do that." Said Hemi.

"Fuck! We're going to be under in seconds!" She climbed up two rungs on the ladder to the bridge, reached up and pulled the hatch down without looking up, cutting off the echoing voice on the loudspeaking explicating an ever-expanding description of pyramidal powers. 

She screwed the squeaking hatch-sealing wheel down tight. The light on the hatch-status board went from red to green.

More bits of lead smacked against the sail and along the hull of the _Prospect_ just below the waterline. Percy winced involuntarily. There was no telling what kind of damage they could be doing. It might be nothing, or it might wound the _Prospect_ in just a particular way that under exactly the right pressure of water, at some unknowable depth, the whole boat would collapse on itself.

Owen looked up at Hemi with fear in his eyes.

Hemi fixed the small frames of his glasses in front of his eyes and looked back at him steadily. "Don't worry. The boat will be safe from bullets underwater. Just get us down."

They could hear the water rushing up the hull and rising around them now as the sail went under the waves. Then they heard the tapping. Not the loud thuds of bullets, but the soft rhythmic bump of someone banging on the hull over their head. A few thumps evenly spaced, as if someone was putting all their strength into them. This was followed by a double-bump, which let them know it wasn't mechanical.

"Gregory." Said Hemi, his face blank.

"Fuck." Said Percy. "There's nothing we can do now." The thumps went on for another few seconds. There was a few weaker ones, and then they stopped.

Chips stood at the foot of the control room ladder looking up at Percy through the hatch. "Damn you." She said softly. "The fucking judges in hell will fuck you for eternity for that, Percy." Chips turned and disappeared towards the stern of the boat.

"Fuck." Said Percy again. She spat. Nobody else said anything. "Flood the fucking dive tanks."

Hemi reached over to the tank trim panel and opened valves that let more water into the boat. Throughout the whole of the _Prospect_ huge volumes of water poured into the ballast tanks as air was displaced up pipes and vented out above them in streams of bubbles. Percy flipped the lights from white to red.

"Set the planes down steep." Said Hemi. "Full power to the electric motors, drive us down as fast as possible." Owen pushed the main throttles all the way forward, and the hum of the powerful electric motors rose up around them mixing with the terrifying sound of water rushing in to fill the boat. The rows of smaller dials showing the tank-fill status, with their pitted chrome casings --- and one with a cracked glass face --- all rose evenly and quickly.

The _Prospect's_ bow tilted towards the depths. Percy and Hemi grabbed the hanging leather straps a counter-angled their ankles against the incline. They were going down fast enough that they could feel their stomachs rise slightly against the descent.

The ship-to-ship radio lit up, and the communication from the pursuing sub continued where it had left off when Percy closed the hatch. "Diving submarine: you are ordered to discontinue your dive. Return to the surface and disengage your engines. If you do not, we _will_ launch a torpedo at you. Under the International Water Territorial Authority Control Aggreement we are permitted to inspect any---" Percy punched the button cutting power to the ship-to-ship radio.


### Figuring out what the pursuing sub is going to do

"If they want to sink us so bad, why didn't they just torpedo us already?" Owen asked.

"They were too close." Hemi replied. "They need to be at a minimum safe distance to fire without risking blowing themselves up. They probably also thought there was a chance they could capture our boat if we had been scared enough to just roll over."

"So we're not that scared?" Asked Bastian. He put a cigarette to his lips for a long draw, not expecting a reply.

"Fuck." Said Percy once more as she sized up the situation. "It must have just been total bad luck for us. There's no way they could have tracked us down in that storm. ...Don't ya think Hemi?"

"It's incredibly unlikely. They may have just been riding out the storm themselves, and suddenly found they were on us."

"And that bad luck cost me a fucking crew member." Added Percy.

Hemi looked away and found himself analying the gauges. They had already achieved 30 meters of depth.

"Cassandra!" Percy yelled down to sonar through the hatch in the floor of the control room. "Stay on them! I need to know what they're doing." 

"I'm trying to Captain Percy." Cassandra responded, unable to hide the uncertainty in her voice. "I... I think they might be diving..."

Percy caught Hemi's eye. "What's their move Hemi? What are they trying to do?"

Hemi considered. "Well, if they are diving, I believe that suggests they want tactical mobility. On the surface, their opportunities to threaten us are extremely limited by the storm."

"Mmm Hmm. By 'tactical mobility' you mean get in range to put a torpedo in the water pointed at us?" Percy asked.

"Out position has baredly changed. They are almost certainly still too close. But if we hear them turn away from us, we can assume they are trying to get enough distance to fire a torpedo. On the other hand, if they don't turn away, they may line up to try to ram us."

"Only a truly suicidal sub driver would try a ramming while submerged. There's too much risk of damaging their own boat beyond repair." 

"There's nothing to indicate that this commander is not suicidal..." Said Hemi flatly.

"Cassandra!" Percy called down again. "What's the range to the contact now?"

"Um.." Cassandra struggled, "I can't really tell Captain Percy. The background noise in the water is still so loud that it's making ranging very difficult."

"You had better go down there and get on sonar with her." Percy said to Hemi.

Hemi nodded and slipped down through the hatch. He put one big hand gently on Cassandra's thin shoulder so he wouldn't surprise her --- she had her eyes closed and seemed to be concentrating very hard on listening. When he touched her she turned an opened her eyes and nodded to him. Hemi put the second sonar headset on.

A minute later he reported to Percy. "Syl, their diesels are off. They are definitely submerged. Range... maybe 300 meters. Hold on..."

The signal strength indicator rose slowly. Cassandra looked up at Hemi.

"They are increasing speed Percy. And turning... through our rear port quarter. They are going for distance. I assume to fire on us."

In the control room, Bastian could hear this report from Hemi. "Maybe they are turning to run away from us." He said to Owen through the cigarette hanging from his lip.

Percy looked at the depth gauge: 100 meters. "Push her down Bastian." She stood behind him and put her hand on his shoulder.

Bastian turned the dive plane control wheel to give the planes a steeper angle. Percy adjusted valves at the tank ballast control panel to give the bow some more weight.

"Hemi!" Percy said. "Let me know immediately if they start to turn."

"If they have rear torpedo tubes, they won't have to turn." Hemi replied. "And they are so close a torpedo will be in the water for only a minute before it his us." He added.

"Fuck." Said Percy. "Let me know if there's any indication they are about to fire Hemi."

"It's tough Syl. Cassandra is right, there's a lot of background noise."

Owen reached up and wiped his fingers on a hanging rag. "I don't think I could ever get used to going down fast like this, controlled or no" He said, as if voicing his fear might let some of it out from his guts and disperse it around the room a little. His eyes were focused on the larger depth gauge that stood next to their speed gauge at the top of the stacks of dozens and dozens of dials and readouts on the front wall of the con. 

[//]: # (Next 3 grafs: need editing relative to what the reader already knows. Earlier in the book it is established that Percy can read the condition of the boat from this wall, I think, so explaining that might be repetitive. On the other hand, there's some good stuff in these grafs that you might want to keep for mood and tension.)
Along with some input from the navigation and sonar stations on the deck immediately below the control room, below periscope depth, this wall of dials was the only source of information about what was happening to the boat, and what was going on outside the boat. The depth, speed, health, status, mechanical settings, the whole picture of how the boat was doing could be read from this wall of dials. And what Owen was reading at the moment was that the sub was being put through the very limits of it's endurable capabilities.  

The rising and falling needles on the dials, most of which moved most of the time with a deliberate and controlled slowness, were all rapidly chasing new positions. The RPM indicators for the electric motors were near red-line, the battery indicators were showing the batteries being drained so fast that he could see the needles falling on the dials. The plane angle indicators were pinned at their steepest angle, and the ballast tank status indicators were rapidly pushing towards a completely flooded boat. 

The depth indicator was the one that Owen's eyes kept coming back to though. He had never seen it move so fast, showing him quantitatively what he knew from the lightened weight of his stomach: the _Prospect_ was a many-thousand-ton steel stone dropping through the water column.  It was hard to imagine what would stop the boat from simply winking out of existence in the never-ending blackness of the deepest parts of the ocean, crushed like distant matter pulled into a singularity. Within a few minutes it was passing through the range of 175 and 180 meters. 


### The sub with the ram fires a torpedo at them

Everyone silently gripped their stations.

"They're turning Percy." Said Hemi. He tapped a light rhythm on Cassandra's shoulder to draw her attention to a new unique sound in their headsets. "Sounds like they are flooding torpedo tubes." 

A loud ping came from the sub with the ram and echoed across the hull of the _Prospect_. The ranging equipment lit up with the exact distance and direction of the pursuing sub. Hemi read the coordinates off the range display and relayed them to Percy. "Their ranging ping puts them at 612 meters of our rear port side." 

"Now they have everything they need to fire on us." Percy said to herself.

Half a minute later Hemi heard the unmistakable sound of a torpedo being pressed out of its tube. "Torpedo in the water!"

Nobody said anything, instinctively listening to the space around them. After a few seconds the ping of the torpedo homing on the _Prospect_ started bouncing of the hull with the timed rhythm of a ticking clock.

"Take off your headset Cassandra." Said Hemi, pointing at the range-finding equipment that lit up with the direction and remaining distance between them and the torpedo. It updated immediately following each ping --- the torpedo was gaining about 100 meters between pings.

"Down, we have to get deeper," Percy whispered to herself in the control room. She reached past Bastian, and turned the dive planes to the stop so they had maximum angle. The boat dropped from under them.

Where a moment before Owen was fearing some unknown depth at which the _Prospect_ would cease to exist, now he felt himself squeezed in the jaws of a closing vise: between an explosive torpedo that could end the _Prospect_ and the crushing pressure of water that could end them.

Percy looked up. They were passing 200 meters. 

The pinging was fast enough that they all knew the torpedo was almost on them.

And then there was a creeping silence where they had all expected the next sound to be their eardrums pressed in by the shock wave of an explosion.

There was nothing but a long lingering silence no longer being split by the ping of the torpedo. The only sound was the groaning of the _Prospect's_ hull being pushed through the continued stress of fast diving.

Owen looked at Percy, "What happened?"

[//]: # (I don't think a torpedo has a pressurized hull, so it wouldn't implode, it would just fail.)
"Most of the torpedoes on these Authority subs are older ones that they manufactured huge numbers of. They can't go below 200 meters or so. The one homing on us probably just stopped functioning when critical componenets failed under the pressure." She paused, thinking to herself. "It's entirely possible that they are loading a more modern torpedo into their tubes right now that can reach us at this depth, and all we've done is delayed the inevitable."

"What are they doing Hemi now?" Percy asked loudly, with a slight tilt of her head. 

Hemi and Cassandra had their headsets back on and were listening. "Sounds like they stopped moving Percy. They may have decided to wait us out." Said Hemi.


### Hiding deep

"OK," she said to Bastian and Owen, "level us out. Hold us at this depth for the moment."

Bastian eased back the wheel on the dive plane while Owen pulled the throttle back to the zero mark, and flipped some switches. The electric hum died away as the deck of the boat came up under their feet to something like level ground.  Bastian open the valves controlling airflow to the ballast tanks, and a soft hissing whispered through the boat.  The ballast tank fill needles worked their way slowly back toward the middle marks on their dials. The depth gauge slowed and slowed, and then finally held level at 232 meters down.

The stress Captain Percy was feeling changed in character. A few moments before her mind was working quickly in the desperate survival mode of flight. Now that immediate pressure was off, replaced by an almost overwhelming cloud of dread as they switched to a mode of silent hiding. 

She looked around her in the crimson gloom. With the motors shut down her boat was completely silent. Their breathing pushed dampness into the air that condensed on the metal fixtures and gathered until it released a soft drip. The randomness of the dripping in the control room was intimidating. 

Bastian knew better than to ask, but Owen did not. "What's our plan Captain?"

"Fuck Owen! Let me think." She stared at the depth gauge, unblinking.

Bastian opened a valve on the tank trim control panel slightly to make a minor adjustment to the level of the boat. Percy noticed his hand shaking as he reached out for the small control wheel.

Percy lit a cigarillo and put it between her lips. "Don't make any moves." She said to Owen and Bastian. She slowly climbed down the ladder to the sonar compartment. Half way down another ping from the sub with the ram bounced off the _Prospect's_ hull and rang through the crew's ears.

"They are 734 meters behind us, rear port quarter. They are at 150 meters deep." Hemi told Percy, reading off the ranging equipment. "Do you think they are about to fire another torpedo?"

Percy stepped over to the sonar console. "I think if they had a torpedo that could swim this deep they would have fired it already. No, I think they just want to be sure we haven't gone anywhere."

"They likely learned we are an unarmed boat the depot as well." Said Hemi. "They no longer have any fear of pinging us."

Percy nodded and thought. "Yes... but I wonder if they would be so quick to ping without a storm overhead. Right now they can reasonably assume there's no other Authority's craft around to hear them. If we can make our way out from under this storm, and into busier shipping channels, they might need to hide nearly as much as we do, and lay off the pings."

Cassandra took a rag hanging from a hook and wiped condensation off the sonar gauges.

Percy pulled Hemi over to the navigation chart. Hemi didn't remove the sonar headset, instead stretching out the wire in the space between the sonar and navigation stations.

"How much battery do we have?" Percy asked Hemi.

"We did OK charging the batteries on the surface during the storm. We have about a half charge on them. We can do a creeping speed for maybe 12 hours." Hemi didn't express his opinion aloud that having gained 12 hours of charge meant they could have, and maybe should have, submerged earlier. And if they had, the would never have encountered the sub with the ram.

"OK. 3 knots, 12 hours. Let's see." Percy measured a compass against a graduated straight edge and deftly spun the compass drawing an arced dashed line on the chart with the grease pencil. "That gets us somewhere along this line."

Hemi nodded.

"Not very much in terms of ocean distances. We can probably get out from under the storm, but we're a long way from any kind of shipping channel."

"Any other features we can use? A relatively shallow place we can hide on the bottom again, like the tablemount?" Hemi asked.

Percy took a long draft off her cigarillo and then leaned closely over the chart. She pulled down the magnifier and guided her vision through it with the tips of her fingers, holding the burning coal of the cigarillo just off the glass. "Ugh. there's nothing but deep sea. Bottomless in every direction. There's nothing for hundreds of miles."

"They are likely looking at the same chart and figuring they can simply wait out our batteries. They know we don't have a full charge since they caught us on the surface." Said Hemi.

"They might not be wrong." Percy stood upright and smoked. "Fuck it. Here's what we're going to do: we're going to creep on a direct course towards Pylon City. If we can lose them, even briefly, we'll surface and try to get in touch with Shakes --- we'll launch the pigeon." She waved her hand in the air in a way that might indicate a bird fluttering off.

"His name is Herschel. And what if Herschel finds, Shakes. Then what?"

"Have him run interference or something. Whatever the hell it is we hired him for!"

Hemi looked grim.

"We need to get something between us and those fuckers up there, whether it's Shakes, other Authority craft, or some feature of the seascape. I just need something to hide my boat under." Said Percy, wracking her mind for options. "Owen! give us 3 knots."

The quiet hum of the electric motor rose up through the silence.

"Hemi, can you stay on sonar?" Percy jerked a thumb towards Cassandra. "Let the kid get in the rack for a few hours."

Hemi nodded again. Cassandra heard Percy and looked at them with relief in her red-rimmed eyes.

While Hemi let Cassandra off duty, Percy climbed back up into the control room and had Owen adjust their rudder so they were on a more direct route.

Ten minutes later another ping echoed through the hull, piercing through the quiet drone of the slowly-moving _Prospect_. Hemi quoted the distance and direction of the ping source to the control room. Percy ground her teeth against the electrical noise that shook her nerves. She willed the pursuers to get lost in the storm that still raged above.

The ping prompted Owen to speak up. "Captain Percy, don't you think we should try talking them into _not_ shooting at us? Someone over there must be a reasonable person and realise we are an unarmed cargo sub."

"The best-case scenario if we can convince them not to shoot is we have to let them aboard for an inspection." Said Percy. "We aren't going to pass any inspections with our current cargo. And something tells me those guys aren't going be open to a bribe either..." She trailed off. "Besides, they are out of ship-to-ship range now --- probably trying to keep enough distance to fire a torpedo at us if we come back up above 200 meters.

They settled into an extremely low-speed chase. The _Prospect_ quietly hummed along through the deep, under 230 meters of water. The pursuing sub stayed closer to the surface but maintained the same distance behind them. The night was dragging on. With the glow of the red lights and the pervading and unchanging hum from the electric motor it didn't take very long for their fears to subside and be replaced with sleepy routine.

But every 15 minutes, like a grating and persistent alarm, another echoing ping broke through the silence. Each ping was always followed immediately after by Hemi's report from the sonar compartment that the pursuing submarine was maintaining nearly exactly the same distance behind them. This he can and did tell them with great precision.

Each new ping reset their anxiety. And their eyes would tear up and their hands would start shaking again. The only relief was the passing of time, but that led inevitably towards the next alarm-ringing ping, and the cycle would start all over again.

This cycle repeated itself without change for hours. The storm continued to spin above them, and their ears rang from the pings and from the silence between them. 

Cassandra showed back up in the sonar compartment, unable to sleep for the pings, and offered to sit at the sonar station again. When Hemi climbed into the control room, Percy had him relieve Owen at the throttle controls and sent Owen to make them some breakfast.


### Breakfast; Owen realizes the sub commander is after him

Half an hour later Owen's voice came over the PA saying breakfast was ready. Captain Percy offered to let Bastian and Cassandra eat first, but Cassandra preferred to stay at sonar. Bastian offered to bring a plate of food up to her and sit at the sub controls himself while he ate. He was back from the galley in a matter of minutes with heaping bowls of steaming food for Cassandra and himself.

Percy held Bastian's bowl of food while he climbed the ladder to the control room. She realized how hungry she was with the smell of it.

"Bastian, keep her going the way we're going. If anything changes, I'll be in the galley. Hemi, want to join me for Breakfast? Maybe we can come up with some kind of plan."

"Absolutely. I am certainly ready to eat." Said Hemi. 

Owen was not nearly the cook Gregory had been. Breakfast was a white mush of crushed up hard biscuit mixed with water and fried with butter. He had stirred in bits of dried salted meat, and was making a pan of scrambled eggs. He kept making more eggs in small batches, so at least they would be hot for the crew coming to eat.

Hemi and Percy loaded up bowls --- Hemi with twice as much as Percy --- of the hot glop, and filled two tin cups of coffee and sat down at the galley table. They ate in silence for a few minutes.

Hemi had let Herschel out of his cage as soon as the bird had come aboard, and Herschel had made his home in the _Prospect's_ galley, claiming any crumb that made it to the deck. He wandered around their feet as they ate.

Another ping rang through the boat.

"Fuck!" Said Percy. "You know Hemi, I just can't fucking figure what the deal is? Why the fuck are they so damn persistent in coming after us?"

"It is strange. The Authorities often aggressively patrol their own waters. But the tension between them means they don't cross each other's lines. Almost always when we see an Authority craft after us over a long distance it's simply because they have claimed new territory from another Authority, and we didn't know it. In this case... I am fairly certain they have chased us from one Authority territory into another, yet they mysteriously persist."

"And it looks like they have every intention of pursuing us into a third..."

"You think it is because they want to take this cargo we're hauling? Perhaps it is the strategic move for them: if we deliver, it undermines their position with another Authority somehow."

"Even for weapons, it's just too fucking risky for one single Authority craft to cross deep into another Authority's area. And a boatload of magnetic warheads? That could be a real prize for a rebel group, but for an Authority it's pretty small potatoes. It's not like we're carrying nerve gas." She thought for a minute, stirring her mush. "Have you ever heard of this sub commander before? What did Shakes say... he had only one arm?"

"And that he was very large." Hemi paused, unsure how he felt about charactering people by this quality that applied to himself as well.

Owen stopped stirring his egg mixture. "Fuck." He said slowly, drawing out the middle vowel in a long drag.

Percy and Hemi turned to look at Owen standing at the galley range.

"You have some input Owen?" Percy asked.

"I... may know why they are after us." Owen hesitated. "About a year ago, before I started working on the _Prospect_, I briefly dated an older woman. She was a submarine commander's wife..."

"You fucked this guy's wife Owen?" Percy asked, starting to get angry. "And you didn't tell us earlier?"

"I didn't know it was the same guy!" Insisted Owen. "There's lots of submarine commanders in the world! What are the chances? Besides, it didn't seem like he cared that much at the time."

"How so?" Percy interrogated.

"Well, I used to meet her at their house --- a big old marble mansion with columns out front and stuff --- and the wife and I would be off in one wing while he was in another. I'm sure he knew what we were up to. She acted like it was totally normal."

"Odd. So why do you think he's the one after us?"

"Well, that woman broke up with me after a few weeks. It was no big deal --- a fun little fling, no hard feelings. A few weeks later, I'm in a bar, standing at the bar, waiting to order a drink. And this huge guy, like as big as Hemi, maybe bigger, wearing a full dress uniform, decorated with medals all along the left side, epaulets and braid, everything --- this guy comes roaring into the bar. He's got a hatchet in his hand and he calls me out, and he says 'You slept with my wife. You're going to die bloody son.'"

"So," said Percy, "whatever happened, something changed and now he has the bloodlust for you?"

"You would think," said Owen, "but the thing is, even in that moment --- what should have been a moment of the most violent, heated passion, right? I mean, he's supposedly there to kill me in rage at my seducing his wife, like a classical play or something --- even then his voice was totally flat. It was like he didn't care, really. He was just going through the motions." Owen thought for a second. "My take is that he didn't care at all about his wife, revenge on me was just something to do. A thing to guide his life, maybe because all those years of executing the will of the Authority he worked for had started to seem pointless."

"So, you think he's going to pursue us around the great circle of the globe because of some sort of misplaced nihilistic existential crisis? Hemi asked.

"Uh, sure. Whatever that means." Said Owen, nodding.

Hemi lifted Herschel up to the table, and balled up some leftover glop scrapings from his bowl and tossed it onto the table in front of the pigeon. Herschel pecked at the glob nonchalantly.

"That's disturbing." Said Percy. "It's going to be difficult to predict the actions of a man motivated by nothing but a _vision_ of revenge. How did you get away from him in the bar?"

"Oh," said Owen, "that was easy. The bar was crowded, he was a big guy. I just ran out the back. He followed but couldn't even come close to keeping up. He just stood there, waving his hatchet in the air yelling cliched notions of revenge after me without putting any heart into it."


### Chips comes in to tell them the bilge pump is broken

At that moment Chips appeared in the hatchway to the galley. She caught Hemi's eye and ignored Percy. "Hemi, the fucking welds along the crack in the fucking cargo hold are weeping pretty fucking aggressively."

Percy's eyes followed Herschel.

"I'm not surprised." Hemi replied. "Running this deep is putting a lot more pressure on the hull, so I'd expect more water coming in. Those welds were never going to be perfect. How bad is it?"

"Well, it would be no fucking problem," said Chips, "but one of the forward fucking bilge pumps has broke the fuck down. And the second forward pump isn't fucking keeping up. We're fucking flooding again."

Captain Percy suddenly remembered the bilge pump at the depot that she had neglected to return to purchase. She looked down at her bowl and scraped a together a spoonful of what remained. 

"Can we fix the broken bilge pump?" Hemi asked.

"No fuckin' way. It's one of the fuckin' originals that came with the fucking boat --- decades old. The brushes are fucking shot."

"Ah. Well..." Hemi turned heftily to look at Owen, "Owen, leave your eggs aside and go down to the cargo hold with Chips. Rig up one or two of the portable bilges to pump into the trim tanks. Hopefully that will hold us until we can come shallower."

"It's like we right fucking back where we started with this fucking mess before we even did any fucking repairs!" Said Chips angrily. She turned towards the cargo hold without waiting for Owen, who was a minute behind her after washing grease from his hands.

"Fuck Hemi," said Percy, "now we have another factor we need to be thinking about in the equation."

"You mean the leaking hull? Or that Chips can't even look at you?"

"The hull. I can't deal with Chips' fucking problems right now. We have a limited window --- that is how long our batteries will hold out --- to find a way to lose these fuckers. I'm open to suggestions."

"We could try shutting down entirely --- maybe they will fly right over the top of us?" Suggested Hemi.

At that moment another ping bounced through the hull of the _Prospect_.

Percy rolled her eyes. "That, of course, is why shutting down and hiding quietly won't work. There's no fucking way they will get out of range of active sonar at the rate we are moving."

"We could speed up, get them to match our speed, then shut down and let them shoot past." Said Hemi.

"How fast would we have to get them going so that they are out of sonar range by their next ping?"

"Assuming they keep pinging every 15 minutes..." Hemi did some quick calculations, touching his thumb to his forefinger as he counted. "Fairly fast. Perhaps 20 knots?"

"We'd use up the entire charge left on our battery in less than an hour at that speed."

"It does indeed seem like this commander knows his tactics." Said Hemi. "A less experienced sub driver would have made more mistakes. I do not see how we have any other option than to continue on our current course, and hope an opportunity presents itself."

"But it fucking kills me to have no plan Hemi."


### The scattering layer

Captain Percy and Hemi refilled their coffee cups and Hemi brought an extra one to Bastian in the control room, who gratefully accepted it into the long fingers of his hand that wasn't holding a smoldering cigarette. Hemi sat down in the planes control seat, and swiveled to review the tank ballast control panel. He made some small adjustments to the ballast to trim the boat more level --- probably to account for the water they were once again taking through the poorly-welded gash in the pressure hull, he thought to himself as part of his trim calculations.

Percy stayed below the control room in the sonar compartment with Cassandra still listening to the sonar. She confirmed with Cassandra that their situation had not changed at all, then stepped to the navigation table. She looked at the clock and then used a pair of calipers to measure against the ruler. She put the calipers to the chart, and marked down a single dash with the grease pencil to show the progress they had made in the last hour. Their progress was painfully slow.

They sank quickly back into the mired boredom of the chase. Bastian lit one cigarette off another as he awkwardly tried to lean back in the control chair and put his feet up on the panel in front of him. Despite the casual repose, he was professional enough with his job that his eyes never left the gauges showing the status of the boat --- even though the array of dials and their indicating needles had not moved or changed for hours on end.

The air thickened with smoke from Bastian and Percy, the condensation of their breathing, and the shallow flatness of having been pass through carbon-dioxide scrubbers. The control room and sonar compartment felt hazy and wet. Hemi continually wiped water droplets from the ballast gauges with a grimy red cotton rag.

Hours passed like this. Hemi and Percy would try to start conversations with Bastian and with each other, instintively knowing that talking was a way to keep alert, but the thick atmosphere and the grinding drone of the motors continually laid down over their conversations like a blanket and stifled them. Besides, every 15 minutes there was the piercing ping from their pursuers that reoriented their attention and their fear.

At some point Owen returned to the control room from below and reported that the portable bilge pumps seemed to be overcoming the weeping water from the welded seam and that they did not have to worry about sinking, for the moment. Owen took over the plane control seat from Hemi, while Hemi reminded him to keep an eye on the ballast tank they were pumping bilge water into --- it would need to be blown out at some point.

With Owen back in the control room, Percy had them start taking half hour breaks. "You're each in the rack for two pings from those fuckers up there." She said to them. 

Hemi took over sonar from Cassandra and sent her off first. He was somewhat concerned about how well she could hold up under the strain of these many hours without sleep, though she protested from behind big watering eyes that she was fine.

Putting on the sonar headset, Hemi could tell immediately that the storm had subsided quite a bit. Cassandra had failed to report that the white noise coming down from the storm-stirred surface above had greatly diminished in the last couple of hours. It was understandable, especially for someone new to sonar --- the change had been gradual enough that it was easy for someone listening to it unbroken to not notice it had changed at all. A very experienced sonar operator would have noted the change on the signal strength gauge. But it was also aparent to Hemi simply because he hadn't put the headset on in a number of hours.

Still, a reduced storm didn't change their situation much in empty seas and scanning around carefully, Hemi didn't hear any other contacts, or much of anything really. The ocean was getting quieter. At some point the pursuing sub might stop pinging simply because they would be able to hear the quiet hum of the _Prospect's_ motors.

Another ping rang the _Prospect's_ hull. But this one sounded instantly distinct to Hemi. He heard the ping as it smacked against the boat, but then he heard it again in his Headset just a split second later, as if they had been pinged a second time from below. His head immediately swiveled to look at the ranging equipment.

"Percy!" He called up to her. "That ping just echoed off the bottom --- it's just a hundred meters or so below us."

"That's impossible Hemi, there's nothing but deep water..." In the control room she was looking at the depth-under-keel gauge, which suddenly in the wake of the ping had stood up from the 'bottomless' pin and was now showing just 96 meters. She watched the gauge and it was slowly, slowly rising, like a gently slope coming up under them.

Percy lit a cigarillo and stared at the gaugues.

"Another tablemount Cap?" Bastian asked.

"No..." said Percy, "this came out of nowhere, it's something weird..." She hung her weight from a strap above her, and leaned over Bastian as she smoked, watching the dept-under-keel gauge slowly rise. "Give us a little more speed Bastian, 10 knots." 

Bastian eased the throttle forward and the hum of the motors doubled in volume.

"Sylvia," Hemi said from below listening to the increased noise of the _Prospect_ in his headset, "at this speed they can definitely follow us on passive sonar without pings."

"Noted Hemi, thank you." Her eyes focused on the depth-under-keel gauge, it rolled back ever so slowly and then it crossed the 20 meter mark. Percy slammed the dive alarm. "Owen, full down plane, right now."

Owen turned the dive plane control wheel, spinning the polished stainless wheel through his fingers quickly until it hit the stop. The bow of the _Prospect_ dropped from under them, and the depth-under-keel gauge fell rapidly towards zero. The depth from the surface gauge started climbing quickly in the opposite direction, from 235 to 240, to 245 meters deep.

"Owen, open the main ballast valves." Percy said.

"We're going down awfully fast Captain, if we open main ballast we're going to hit the bottom and split apart."

"Fucking damn it kid! I'm the fucking Captain." She reached over Owen to the ballast tank control panel and flipped open the main ballast valves herself. They could hear a rush of air escaping above them as water flooded into the main ballast tanks from below. 

It was a sound they heard all the time, but at this depth it reminded Owen how unique a sound it was to a submarine --- on any other ship it was the sound of death. He was not convinced that in this particular case it would not also be the sound of the _Prospect's_ death --- at the hands of a captain who had snapped under the strain of days without sleep on a constant edge of terror.

After hours of staring at the walls of dials in front of him stubbornly refusing to move, suddenly it seemed like all the dials were climbing or falling --- all in a directions that read as doom for the boat. The depth was rapidly increasing, their speed was increasing, the ballast tanks were filling with water, and the bottom --- Owen could see it in his head: black and thick, gooey enough that the boat might sink meters into it, and hard enough that it might break the _Prospect's_ spine when it hit --- the bottom was flying up at them. Perspiration ran freely down Owen's temples.

Bastian quietly wrapped his long thin fingers around the throttle control, ready to yank it back to reverse the motors... perhaps before Percy even asked him to. His other hand reached out in front of him and pressed palm-forward against the steel of the console, in a near-subs copious gesture to brace himself.

Captain Percy stood behind them, one arm slung above her with her wrist entangled in the overhead strap. her other hand held the cigarillo, aflame with a long thin string of smoke rising upwards at a slant angle relative to the orientation of the control room in the steeply diving boat. She stared at the depth-under-keel gauge.

Seconds later the depth-under-keel gauge tapped the zero pin. 

Owen and Bastian winced, waiting for the breaking, popping shudder that would be what the end of the _Prospect_ felt like.

Another second after that, the gauge spun wildly and pegged itself against 'bottomless' on the other side of the dial. It flipped over wtih such force that Owen could hear the tap of thin needle against the pin in the quiet of the control room. The depth gauge next to the depth-under-keel gauge continued to rise steadily past 250 meters.

The _Prospect_ let out a long low groan that echoed through the whole boat.


### Hiding under the scattering layer

"Level her off!" Said Percy. She had calmly and confidently driven her ship through the false bottom, but now they were up against the very limits of the depths the boat was capable of. A few more seconds of descending, and they would fall into the hole, and never see the surface again.

Bastian immediately reversed the throttle, and Owen spun the dive plane control wheel around in the opposite direction to steer the bow back upwards with one hand while at the same time he flipped shut the main ballast valve switches on the tank control panel with the other.

The engineers who designed the _Prospect_ intended the boat to operate normally down to 215 meters. But Percy had pushed the boat beyond that many times, and despite the age of the boat had full confidence in its ability to withstand 250 meters of depth, though she was only willing to test that confidence in an emergency. Beyond that was the mystery of the death zone. The original engineers anticipated full collapse of the boat at 300m. But terrible things could happen in that range between 250 and 300 meters that they were passing into at the moment.

Every 10 meters further down added another atmosphere of pressure to the hull. The equivalent of another entire column of the weight of the air on the surface pressing down from space. And against that had to stand the measly one atmosphere of pressure inside the _Prospect_, reinforced with the strength of the steel pressure hull. On a boat 100 meters long like the _Prospect_, in a steep dive like this, the bow could easily already be under an entire atmosphere more pressure than what the depth gauge (that measured from the sail) was showing Percy. A small adjustment in the wrong direction of the huge planing fins that guided the sub up or down, or one valve accidentally left partially open and flooding a ballast tank could take them down that last critical ten meters in a matter of seconds. Percy knew they were within meters of cross the unknowable line where critical parts of the _Prospect_ would fail, and they would never get the boat to rise again.

The _Prospect's_ motors were spinning the propeller in reverse now, pulling hard against the fall of the boat.

"Watch the forward speed Bastian!" Percy warned. "If we start moving backwards with the dive planes set like that, you'll swing the bow deeper instead of shallower. Don't let her reverse direction."

"On it Cap." Said Bastian, his eyes watching the speed gauge. With full reverse thrust, it was rapidly falling towards zero, but they still had enough forward momentum that the bow was slowly rising. As soon as their speed came below a single knot, Bastian pushed the throttle into neutral. The bow had come up almost level at this point.

The climb of the depth gauge had slowed dramatically, and was now only barely moving --- but still moving --- higher and deeper.

"The ballast!" Yelled Percy. She stepped to the tank control panel and flipped switches and spun open a selection of the dozen of small valve control wheels in front of her. There was a hiss of air from deep in the boat as the high pressure system blew water out of some of the trim tanks. The boat came back to almost completely level. Percy continued to work the tank ballast panel, putting air back into the main ballast.

The depth guage came to a slow stop at 263 meters.

Hemi climed up from sonar. He looked at the depth. "New record?" He asked as his eyes found Percy's.

"Nope. But a close second. I had her down to 267 once." As if to remind Percy of the stress it was currently bearing the _Prospect_ let a long slow groan rise from the guts of the boat. "My poor girl." Said Percy. "Sorry baby, we'll take some of the weight off soon."

"What happened back there?" Asked Owen. "I thought we were going to hit the bottom for sure." 

[//]: # (Make sure it's actually morning at this point! Actually --- the dsl comes shallow at NIGHT, so you should really work the timing so that this happens at night)
"False bottom." Said Percy. "The deep scattering layer --- billions and billions of tiny bony fish rising for their morning feed --- such a mass of them together that they reflect sonar back up, and they look like the bottom. We swam right through them, and came out underneath."

"Just when you think there's nothing new to learn on a submarine..." Said Bastian.

Another ping from the pursuing submarine hit the _Prospect_, but this time it had a different quality to it --- not just less powerful, but also diffuse and muted, as if it were coming from much further away than the last ping.

"So... they can't see us now because of the layer of fish between us and then?" Owen asked.

"With any luck their active sonar is nothing more than a fishfinder now." Percy replied. "And we'll just keep ourselves very quiet for a few minutes here."

"Maybe I should go back to my bunk then?" Cassandra asked, looking up at Percy from the compartment below, having returned from her short and harrowing break.

Another muted ping rang through the _Prospect_.

"I don't think they are going to let you sleep Cassandra." Said Percy. "Can you get back on sonar and see if you can figure out what their next move is?"

"Sure Captain Percy." Cassandra said tiredly before flopping into the sonar station chair.

A few seconds passed and another ping rang out.

"They've lost us." Said Hemi. "Now they're searching."

The gaps between the pings became a few seconds, with no regular intervals.

"Cassandra, can you tell what they're doing?"

"They've got their motors going --- pretty loud." Cassandra listened for another second as a ping passed through them. " They're moving at a good clip... It sounds like they're starting to turn in a circle?"

"Starting a search pattern." Said Hemi.

"And they're moving quickly and loudly because they are relying on active sonar. I think I might go so far as to describe it as somewhat desperate in character too. They've definitely lost us." Percy added.

"So, when do we make our move? Can we sneak away?" Asked Hemi.

"Go down to navigation and start tracking them from their pings. We'll move when they are furthest from us."

"Alright." Hemi moved down to the navigation table. For the next 15 minutes every time he heard a ping from the sub with the ram he looked at the ranging equipment on the sonar and marked down the searching sub's precise location on the chart. Some of his dots were wildly off in random directions because the deep scattering layer was interfering with the ranging equipment. But they sub with the ram sent out so many active pings that Hemi was able to chart a precise course of their movement. It was a circle that began where the _Prospect_ had dropped through the deep scattering layer, and turned in a long 3 mile arc away from that point.

"Percy." Hemi called up to the control room as the latest ping showed their pursuers at nearly 5 nautical miles away. "It looks like they are at the apogee of their search arc. Now might be a good time to move."


### They run under the scattering layer

"Thanks Hemi. Keep plotting them." She called down. "Can you also give me a random course in some direction away from them? True random, if you can."

"One moment." Hemi replied. He pulled a book off the shelf that contained nothing but a million random numbers, plus instructions for selecting one of the numbers at random. Hemi looked at the chart and estimated about a dozen possible directions they could move that would take them away from the sub with the ram. Then he used the book to select a random number which he transposed into one of his dozen courses. "Here's a true random bearing Percy: 163."

"OK Bastian, make it 3 knots, come about to 163."

Bastian eased the throttle forward and the speed needle lifted slowly up off its zero pin. He turned the rudder wheel and the boat leaned slightly into the turn.

"Keep her level Owen --- we're too deep to make any mistakes." Said Percy.

Owen gave a gentle nudge to the bow plane control wheel so the boat would come up just a hair with the new forward momentum on it.

They cruised ever so slowly and silently away from the spot where they crossed the deep scattering layer. The pings from the sub with the ram quickly got more and more faint, though they could still hear them bouncing softly off the _Prospect_ long after Cassandra reported that she could no longer hear the pursuing sub's motors.

Percy stood directly behind Owen, carefully double checking his every move to make sure they didn't accidentally gain any depth and sink below the crush depth of the _Prospect_. After an hour, she personally relieved Owen in the dive plane control seat and sent him to his rack for a break.

At 3 knots the _Prospect's_ motor made just enough noise that with the right filters in place, Hemi could hear the echo of the Prospect off the deep scattering layer above them. He showed Cassandra what to listen for, and pretty soon she could give a rough estimate of their depth below the mass of fish. It stayed above them for more than 2 hours, but then Cassandra told Percy she could hear it coming slowly down on top of them --- the fish were beginning their daily vertical migration back down the water column to the safety of the very deep, far below the capabilities of the _Prospect_. 

At the depth they were cruising at, near the very limits for the _Prospect_, the boat continually let out long moans as the steel flexed under the weight. The sounds had a visceral impact on Captain Percy, as if her child were suffering. So it was with a sense of relief that they passed back through the mass of fish as the school descended. Once they were back above the scattering layer, there was no purpose to staying so dangerously deep, so she adjusted the bow planes and the _Prospect__ rose to a much more comfortable 200 meters of depth.

When Owen came back from his break, Percy stepped down the ladder to the sonar compartment and joined Hemi at the navigation table.


### They come up in a fog bank

"Our next challenge," said Hemi as she stepped up to the lighted chart, "is how long the batteries will last."

"Don't think for a fucking second that isn't front of my fucking mind." Said Percy. "Coupla hours left, at best. Then we have to surface --- and barring another storm, we're bright radar targets for those fuckers with the ram. They'll be back on us before we can get the fucking ballast tanks pumped fully out."

"Do you have another trick we can use that I haven't seen before like the deep scattering layer?"

"That move depended far too much on luck and a dangerous gamble Hemi. Luck and gambling is no way to run a submarine. The odds are never in our favor. What I want is a fucking plan that is reliable and executable."

"I once again have nothing for you at this time." Said Hemi. "So perhaps luck will come through one more time."

"Fuck me." Said Percy. "I'm going to lay down for a minute. Run the batteries down, and get me when we have only emergency reserves left."

Percy climbed down a deck and disappeared forward into the Captain's cabin. She was out almost immediately as she fell into her rack, a power she had gained from long years of experience working with short sleep on subs.

They motored nearly silently though the black depths for another two hours before the battery depletion warning lights lit up on the electrical system panel in the control room. Hemi had them shut the motors down and keep the boat hovering steadily in place while using very little power. He went down to the Captain's cabin and woke Percy. They returned to the sonar compartment together, updated their probably position on the chart --- still a long way from anywhere --- and took the only reasonable action they could take: rise to periscope depth and have a look around.

Not wanting to waste battery power driving up to the surface, they opened the high-pressure air system just a bit on the main ballast tanks to gain a little buoyancy and slowly floated upwards. The watch the depth gauge rotate back to the left making its way steadily towards zero. At periscope depth, Hemi flooded enough of the trim tanks to hold them there. Percy put the scope up.

"Holy fuck, Hemi." She said quietly, with her eyes in the viewport of the periscope. She rotated around the periscope, swinging it around 360 degrees, as every submarine commander is trained to do their first day using a periscope. "Would you fucking believe our luck is still with us? It's a fucking damn thick gray fog bank. In every direction."

Hemi smiled. "Makes sense --- it was probably a big warm wall of air pushing that storm, and now all that hot air is sitting on the surface of the cold ocean, turning into a cloud."

"Alright! So much for needing a fucking plan! Start up the low-pressure compressors, and put us on the surface."

Hemi flipped some switches on the ballast control panel and the hum of compressors vibrated up from far below deck. The _Prospect_ rose in place until the deck of the boat broke through the slate-gray ocean and then water washed off and over the curved sides.

* They could be waiting until nighttime to surface, fix this:
	* they should go under the dsl at night
	* fix breakfast meal...
	* and then come up in the morning with no batteries
	* then they can make the run in the fog bank, and keep running through the night on the surface

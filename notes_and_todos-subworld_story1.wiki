# Subworld Story 1 --- notes and todos
* [ ] How do you leverage this good start up to something that might be MacArthur-noticeable?
	* It's not the right subject for those people, so you have to overcome that
	* Can you keep it accessible and entertaining and ALSO bump it into MacArthur territory?
	* See notes from rising grime story about style
		* (Thinking about Ministry or Motorhead: accessibility + distinctive aesthetic is the key <- This is _everything_ that I want from my art!)
	* Take the time to KEEP practicing style to get it aesthetically just the way you want it AND functionally just the way you want it before you build out the whole story.
	* I know exactly what I want it to _feel_ like... but I don't know how to make that thing yet.
	* You can't just _discover_ an aesthetic style; you have to _internalize_ it, and I suspect that can only come from practice. 
		* once internalized, you can probably apply other things to it: like making it accessible.
	* The _aesthetic_ of it -- and the ability to drive a certain cathartic response -- is the key to the MacArthur category; and to what you personally want from your writing as well.
* [ ] Next up: make sure to incorporate drafts from below and from style experiments into the pseudocode
* remember to include a lot of spatial description: the reader should be able to SEE the sub/spaces in their head. 
	* build a map in their head for them.
	* See notes on memory house in writing
* maybe with the engine running full blast, it SOUNDS heavy and grimey, like dopesmoker.
	* try to think about what a listener to dopesmoker would want to read. 
* think carefully about where you "dive" into description:
	* character's clothing, for example, should just be mentioned in casual passing: "she placed the pencil into the front pocket of her cracking leather overalls."
	* but you might want to go all-in with description when they are staring at dials under pressure.
* remember to focus on _description_ of the grime, darkness, cold, hardness. Make it feel like Deadwood or Blood Meridian, though with good story. Do NOT make it feel like a sci-fi or naval/military story.
* consider NOT having any exterior shots. 
	* it may help the sense of isolation and being in a can if all action takes place _inside_ (the depot, the _Prospect_, the _Gnat_) 
* [ ] add something explaining that the Prospect has no torpedo tubes:
	* "Can't we fire a torpedo at them?" Asked a naive youngster. "We're not a warship, we don't have torpedo tubes!" Replied Percy
* [ ] do you want to have a more exciting opening ala Mickey Spillane --- start in the middle of some violence?
	* If you want to try to sell it as a novel before finishing it, this might help pitch the book
* [ ] See if any of the above notes should be copied over to shuttlebay
* For story description: "For them, the only way to know the difference between living and dying is the small movement of a needle on a gauge."

## 'staring at dials' draft section
* {See style experiments in sub world shuttle bay for draft experiments of generalized scenes of going deep, staring at dials, listening. This section is for experimenting within the pseudocode 1.1 structure you already laid out.}




"I don't think I could ever get used to going down fast like this, controlled or no." said {Donovan}, as if voicing his fear might let some of it out from his guts and disperse it around the room a little. His eyes were focused on the larger depth gauge that stood next to their speed gauge at the top of the stacks of dozens and dozens of dials and readouts on the front wall of the con. Along with some input from the nav station and the listening station on the deck immediately below the con, below periscope depth, this wall of dials was the only source of information about what was happening to the boat, and what was going on outside the boat. The depth, speed, health, status, mechanical settings, the whole picture of how the boat was doing could be read from this wall of dials. And what {Donovan} was reading at the moment was that the sub was being put through the very limits of it's endurable capabilities.  The rising and falling needles on the dials, most of which moved most of the time with a deliberate and controlled slowness, were all rapidly chasing new positions. The RPM indicators for the electric motors were near red-line, the battery indicators were showing the batteries being drained so fast that he could see the needles falling on the dials. The plane angle indicators were pinned at their steepest angle, and the ballast tank status indicators were rapidly pushing towards a completely flooded boat. The depth indicator was the one that {Donovan's} eyes kept coming back to though. He had never seen it move so fast, showing him quantitatively what he knew from the lightened weight of his stomach: the _Prospect_ was a many-thousand-ton steel stone dropping through the water column. It was hard to imagine what would stop the boat from simply winking out of existence in the never-ending blackness of the deepest parts of the ocean, crushed like distant matter pulled into a singularity.

Depth gauge check: between 175 and 180 meters. Everyone silently gripped their stations.

"They're turning Percy!" Cass called. And a minute later, "torpedo!"

In a few moments they could hear the ringing ping of the torpedo's homing sonar echoing through the _Prospect_, the frequency of the pulses steadily getting quicker.

"Down, we have to get deeper." Percy whispered to herself.

Where a moment before {Donovan} was fearing some unknown depth at which the _Prospect_ would cease to exist, now he found himself squeezed in the jaws of a closing vise, between an explosive torpedo that could end the _Prospect_ and the crushing pressure of water that could also end them.

Percy looked up. They were passing 200 meters. The pinging was fast enough that they all knew the torpedo was almost on them. And then there was a creeping silence where they had all expected the next sound to be their eardrums pressed in by the shock wave of an explosion.

"The torpedo imploded Percy!" cried Cass.

{Donovan} looked at Percy, hoping for an explanation.

"Most of the torpedoes on these Authority subs are older ones they manufactured huge numbers of. They can't go below 200 meters or so. It's possible that they are loading a more modern ones into their tubes right now that can reach us, and all we've done is delayed the inevitable.  Keep diving {Donovan}."

"212 meters down." Said {Donovan}. {perhaps something about every 10 meters being another atmosphere goes here -- see other style experiments writings}

"What are they doing Cass?" Percy asked loudly.

A silent moment passed, and then Cass called back, "they've leveled off around 200 meters down. Seems like they aren't willing to follow us deep."

"They are going to wait us out." Percy said to Hemi.

"They probably figure we don't have a full battery charge and they won't have to wait very long, and they are right: we're at about 40%." Said Hemi, glancing over the battery charge dials.

"OK {Donovan}, level us out. Hold us at this depth for the moment."

{Donovan} eased up the wheel on the dive plane, pulled the throttle back to the zero mark, and flipped some switches. The electric hum died away as the deck of the boat came up under their feet to something like level ground. {Gregory} eased open some of the valves controlling airflow to the ballast tanks, and a soft hissing whispered through the boat.  The ballast tank fill needles worked their way slowly back toward the middle marks on their dials. The depth gauge slowed and slowed, and then finally locked in at 232 meters.

--------------------

{
{Donovan} was starting to panic, his eyes were wide and unblinkingly
scanning the wall of dials, and sweat was running in threads down his
temples. The tips of his fingers were wrapped around the dive plane
controls, ready for the instant he could level off the boat, not wanting
to risk a stray meter downward he didn't have to. Percy stepped forward,
her feet angled against the incline of the deck, and put her hand on his
shoulder. She watched the dials more calmly. At their current depth she
was not worried about her boat, even going through stressing maneuvers
like this. She was worried about the one following them.

"Cass, stay on them. Let me know exactly what they are doing."
Percy called down to the listening station.

"So what do we do Hemi?"

"I've been thinking about it. We can assume they are moving away from
us. They'll probably move pretty fast, enough that we can hear their
electric motors. What if we follow them? Try to stay close enough that
they can't shoot at us? At least until we can figure out something
else."

"I'm sure they will expect us to try to slink off, so that at least has
the element of surprise. It might give us a chance to figure something
out. Maybe we can find the _Gnat_ and Shakes can run interference."

"It's a big risk, because they'll almost certainly find us in moments if
we are close by."
}

--------------------

{
A loud ping passed through the length of the hull of the _Prospect_.

"Woop!" Cass yelled up through the hatch to the con. "Well, they
know where we are now. But we know where they are too, hang on..." At
her listening station, Cass read numbers off of readout that had
locked in when they detected the overwhelming signal of the ping. She
punched numbers from those readouts into a little calculating machine
that was screwed to the wall next to her, and twisted some dials. {this
might actually be automatic from the sonar rig} "Pers, they are under at
120 meters, 560 meters from us at 172 degrees." Cass stepped over
to the chart table at the nav station and looking to over to re-read the
numbers again from the computing machine, marked their position and the
position of the Authority sub on the chart.

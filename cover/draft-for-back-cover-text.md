Tumultuous international relations leave Authorities sparring for control of the surface of the world, and forcing international shipping to move under the ocean via submarines fitted out for transporting cargo. The _Prospect_ is one such submarine, piloted by a small crew that fights a daily battle to keep their rusting old boat from dropping into the depths while trying to get their cargo delivered on time. It's a manageable way to generate income, until the crew finds themselves inexplicably pursued across great expanses of ocean by a military submarine that demonstrates aggression far out of proportion to the basic work of logistics and pushes the captain and her crew to drive the _Prospect_ to the very edge of its mechanical capabilities to survive long enough to make their delivery. 

With a heritage that is equal parts 1960s submarine movie and 1970s trucker movie, _By Sound Alone_ both leverages the power of confined spaces and dangerous operations that submarine stories have long made use of, and at the same time breaks new ground by setting the story in a world where submarines are a critical part of global infrastructure, while never deviating from a commitment to realistic submarine mechanics and operations.

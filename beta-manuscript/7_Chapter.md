# 7. Garbage Gyre


[//]: # (### Rendezvous with Shakes)

[//]: # (--- EDITED TO HERE ---)

With darkness, Hemi was able to take a sighting from a star, and he calculated they had made about 20 nautical miles from the point where they began their dive below 300 meters. Percy felt that was enough of a cushion that they could start the diesels --- on the surface at this range they were more likely to be detected on radar than sonar anyway. The diesels were soon roaring below decks. Percy had them throttle up to 15 knots, and Hemi calculated a precise easterly course that would bring them to the rendezvous point with Shakes. Percy kept a lookout in the ring throughout the night and gambled on not using the radar, feeling that it was too likely to give them away.

They ran through the night on too much coffee and not enough sleep. But they saw no other vessels and there was no sign of the sub with the ram.

Even as the sun rose before them, Percy kept the boat on the surface wanting to make up some of the time they had lost during the previous day. She was hoping to make the rendezvous with Shakes more or less on time. 

The sun was well up above the horizon and they had clear visibility for something like ten miles from the lookout ring before Percy finally called for the submarine to submerge. They had only a few more miles to go to the rendezvous point with Shakes, and Percy had high confidence that Hemi would navigate them very precisely to the correct spot.

A few hours later Hemi announced they had arrived at the rendezvous point. They leveled the boat at 20 meters of depth, and shut down the motors to wait. Everyone except Cassandra passed the midday and afternoon hours catching up on sleep and lazy recuperation. Cassandra was stuck listening to sonar to detect the approach of Shakes. In the late afternoon she caught the far-off sound of a loud diesel engine, and by the time ten minutes had passed she was sure it was the _Gnat_, approaching the rendezvous a high speed on the surface.

At a few miles off, the sound of the diesel disappeared. Cassandra assumed Shakes was diving before approaching the rendezvous point. She called Hemi up to the control room. An hour later Shakes voice came over the ship-to-ship. Hemi arranged with Shakes to mate the _Gnat_ to the underside of the _Prospect_. It took another hour to execute the delicate maneuver.

Hemi sent Bastian down to the lowest deck of the _Prospect_ to open the hatch to the _Gnat_. Even as he climbed up through the hatch, helped by Bastian's strongly gripping hand, Shakes was already thinking about food.

"Bastian! Good to fuckin' see you again. It's about dinner time on this fuckin' vessel, ain't it?"

"Sure it fucking is, Captain Shakes," said Bastian, through a cigarette in his mouth. "I think I smelled Gregory working on some fucking sticky glop or other in the galley, when I was making my way down here. You're hungry?"

"Submarining is fucking hungry work Bastian. Let's go see what that feller is burning."

They made their way up the decks with the wrenches hanging from Shakes' belt clanking loudly each time they ascended one of the ladders or steep stairways. In the galley, Hemi and Percy were sitting at the table and Gregory had a big curved steel pan from which smoke was rising. They all sat and ate a heavy meal of boiled oats and cabbage with small bits of slightly-charred canned ham sprinkled throughout. The oats had enough texture still left to them that the little grains popped between their teeth. Hemi brought a bowl in to Cassandra who was still on sonar duty.

After Shakes ate his third bowl, Gregory poured them all a cup of the requisite coffee that came after every meal, and Percy leaned back into the corner of the galley bench, stretching her arms.

"I see you made it out of that fuckin' Stilt City," said Shakes, "when that sub turned off the channel to follow the _Prospect_ into that narrow waterway, I thought maybe our partnership was fuckin' done for."

"Yet you still managed to make the fuckin' rendezvous point," said Captain Percy.

"Well that last job working for you was so fuckin' profitable, I wasn't just going to let that go because I thought y'all were fucking dead."

Percy laughed.

"So what's the fuckin' plan now? Is there a next job?" asked Shakes.

"For the moment, the plan is to put as much distance between ourselves and the last place we saw that fucking _Grackle_ as possible. We have to lose those fuckers for good if we're going to resume business as usual --- I see that now. I can cut you loose if you like Shakes --- this is mostly our fuckin' headache, not yours."

Shakes stirred a number of spoonfuls of sugar into his coffee. "And what if I'm willing to make it my headache too?"

"Regardless of what fouled spring from which our continuous fuckin' bad luck flows, I'd be happy to have you along if you're fuckin' willing. Having the _Gnat_ around could prove useful again."

"So you'll keep me on fuckin' retainer?"

"Sure, if you like."

"Alright," said Shakes, "with the condition that you make Gregory continue to feed me, I'll fucking stick with y'all for now."

"You know I do take care of a few other things on this boat besides the fuckin' food," said Gregory.

Percy ignored Gregory. "Once it seems like we've gotten ourselves some distance, we'll put into a port somewhere and start looking for work again. And hopefully we'll be able to include the _Gnat_ in whatever new endeavor we take up."

[//]: # (### underwater bicycle race)

For the next three days and nights the two boats ran next to each other. They fell back into the steady routine of a cargo run, moving fast with the power of diesels at night, and slowly crawling along underwater during the day. They crossed almost a thousand miles of ocean, and Percy was feeling like they might soon be able to consider heading into a port somewhere and returning to normal work. 

But first, she felt like they all needed a bit of a break. At the breakfast table on the fourth day, while they were hovering underwater with the _Gnat_ attached but without motors, Percy proposed some recreation.

"Gentlemen. You know what? It's probably time we got some fucking exercise. How about a bicycle race tonight?"

[//]: # (2021-09-26: Half-asleep this morning I suddenly had the terrible thought that the cargo hold was nowhere big enough for a bicycle race. Something someone had said to me at a picnic in the park last night about how they used to store food in cans on the floor of submarines and walk on them, slowly eating their floor level lower made me think that my whole sense of the cargo hold space might be wrong. It's a submarine, submarines are always cramped, tight spaces, right? Even with a cargo hold, maybe that space feels more like being in the trailer of a semi truck than the cavernous cleared factory floor where I had experienced a bicycle race like this myself. You _could_ do a bike race on small bikes in a semi trailer, but the fun would be pretty limited --- unless the truck were moving! Anyway, with this thought I was worried I might have to re-write whole sections of the book. I had dreamed up the cargo hold as this big, dark, dank, creepy underwater space. But maybe I needed to rewrite it to be a long space jam-filled with stuff, and it felt like that even when it was empty of cargo? And I would have to delete this lovely surreal underwater bicycle race scene --- which I am very fond of even though it might have to be cut in the end anyway. I got out of bed and re-examined my diagrams and reassured myself that my original sense of the space was alright. The _Prospect_ is a big sub. That makes sense, cargo subs would have evolved larger the way cargo ships on the surface have, and the cargo hold in it would feel like the cargo hold of a ship, not a semi trailer. The cargo hold isn't a quarter mile long like today's cargo ships might have, but its still a big empty space. This is a wonderful thing about an imaginative fictional work: visualizing a huge underwater cargo space that doesn't exist anywhere, but certainly _could_, and how it feels to be in that space, and the things that one could do with that space --- like a bike race.)

Hemi nodded, but Shakes was deeply confused. "A bicycle race? Is that some kind of code for some fucked-up submariner thing?"

"Well, the 'race' part might be a bit of a stretch, but the bicycle part is literal. Hemi, want to lead our guest down to the hold and show him how we do exercise on this boat?"

"Captain Shakes," said Hemi, "allow me to formally invite you to the only undersea bicycle race in the world." Hemi stood and swept his arm forward toward the cargo hold.

In the cargo hold, Hemi unchained the pile of rusty bicycles from the tie-down points on the wall.

"As you may be aware," said Percy looking at the bit of a gut Shakes was showing after stashing away his giant portion of Gregory's meal, "submarining is maybe not the healthiest of occupations --- even when we're not being fucking shot at. As a captain, it is my duty to look after all aspects of the welfare of my crew. For that reason I encourage time spent on deck for the fresh air --- when fuckin' possible --- and require participation in all _Prospect_ bicycle races." She pointed down the empty cargo hold. "Generally, we conduct races when... well, when the fucking hold is empty enough that we can."

"Fuckin' cool," said Shakes. "What's the rules?"

"The single rule is: don't get fucking hurt... badly," said Percy.

"That's fuckin' it?"

'That's it." Percy pointed over to the pile of bicycles that Hemi was untangling and tossing one-by-one towards them. "Select your steed. Choose carefully, most have a surprise or two."

[//]: # (2k words from last EDIT point)

Shakes looked over the bicycles, which could only be called 'bicycles' if the only thing you knew about bicycles was that they had two wheels. Piled on the grating of the deck, they looked more like a giant rusting Mikado set laid out to play. Any individual bicycle appeared to be missing some critical part or another: a seat, or handle bars, or pedals. Or one of the wheels would have a giant dent in it so there was no chance it would roll smoothly. One or two appeared to be missing structural tubes and looked like they would collapse under the weight of an adult. Some were clearly bikes intended for children, with tiny wheels and faded and ripped streamers hanging from their tiny handlebars. On one someone had welded a motorcycle fork with a motorcycle wheel. Shakes guessed that particular 'bicycle' must weigh more than 50 kilograms.

Shakes selected a promising looking machine from the pile Hemi was still adding to. An simple small steel frame with upright bars and fenders, and the rusting remains of a steel basket, bent and crushed but still hanging on the front of the bicycle. Shakes stepped over it and looked at Percy. "OK, now what?"

"Now? There and back, and there again!" Said Percy, pointing down to the end of the cargo hold.

"Come on," said Bastian, picking up one of the kid's bikes and folding his long skinny legs into position on it. "I'll fuckin' race you."

"I thought the only rule is don't get hurt?" Shakes asked.

"Don't get hurt, _badly_. Fucking yeah." Bastian lit a cigarette, and started pedaling away madly down the grating of the cargo hold. After ten meters or so he slapped the pedals backwards and skidded for five more meters. "Fucking deck is still wet from the flooding! Good skidding." He said looking towards Percy with the cigarette still between his lips.

Shakes took off after Bastian and, since he was riding a bigger bicycle, easily caught Bastian who was now spinning the tiny bicycle at a high cadence. But as Shakes tried to come around, Bastian swerved hard into him and drove Shakes into one of the old crates pushed up against the hull wall. 

Shakes shuffled and regained his perch on the bike. He ripped his way down the deck, getting more speed as he flew past Bastian. He approached the far end, and squeezed the brakes to take some speed off before he had to make the turn to reverse direction. The brake levers clapped easily against the bars. 

Brakes apparently were not a feature of the bicycle he was riding.

Shakes slapped his boots flat and slipped along with the grating uselessly rumbling beneath his feet. There was nothing that was going to prevent him from plowing into the puddle of black and oily bilge water that still filled the bow of the boat. A great spray of oozing and stinking water flew up and soaked him through.

Bastian had skidded the children's bike he was riding to a stop precisely at the edge of the puddle and stood over it, alternately smoking and laughing at Shakes.

Fortunately Shakes was wearing his heavy rubber deck boots. He waded back up out of the bilge puddle pushing the bike between his legs and once he escaped the puddle started pedaling back up the deck. Bastian fell in behind, and stood up to pedal furiously. As Bastian drew even, Shakes unclipped one of the larger adjustable wrenches from his belt, hefted it in his hand for a second and then thrust it into the spokes of Bastian's front wheel.

The weak and loose spokes of the old wheel snapped and curled around the drop-forged steel of the wrench. The wheel gave up on life, and the fork plowed into the grating through a web of small steel wires. Bastian collapsed over the bars and Shakes left him behind. As Shakes approached Percy at the top end of the cargo hold, his feet flattened against the deck in what was now a slightly more practiced maneuver, with plenty of time to skid to a stop where Percy was standing.

"If you kill one of my fuckin' crew members, I'm dropping your boat into the fuckin' deepest part of the ocean Shakes."

"It's not my fault if I'm just naturally fuckin' tougher than y'all."

Hemi easily hefted the bicycle with the motorcycle fork welded to it. He looked at Shakes. "Come on Shakes, let us ride." He started down the cargo hold at a steady pace. Shake caught up with him easily, but despite steering into Hemi multiple times and repeated efforts to twist Hemi's handlebars, had no success at keeping himself from ending up in the oily puddle of bilge again as the two riders arrived at the far end of the cargo hold.

The riding went on like this, with various crew taking turns, swapping out bikes, pointing out what worked and what did not when it came to staying upright, or plowing someone else down. After half an hour or so Hemi dragged a rotting old wooden ramp from among the random refuse lashed to the hull and set it up just at the end of the cargo hold. Bastian shot down the length of the cargo hold and went up off the ramp and deliberately aimed to come down in the bilge water and splash as high up on to the hull as he could manage. 

The bike came to a stop with a precarious tilt. Shakes got off the bike and walked it back up the cargo hold towards Percy and Hemi. When he got a bit closer they could see the front wheel was no longer attached to the bike. "The fucking fork snapped in half!" He shouted up to them.

Percy grinned, "that frame was aluminum and that's how aluminum fails --- snaps in pieces with no warning. That's why submarine hulls are made of steel, it bends when it fails, but stays in tact."

Shakes laughed at that. "Maybe, but if you're at the point where your submarine hull is failing, is it better that it's slowing fuckin crushin' in around you instead of failing catastrophically? Or is that just a vivid fuckin' demonstration of a living hell?"

Bastian wheeled the destroyed bicycle up to them. Percy and Hemi prodded the failed fork in turn while Gregory took a spin down the cargo hold toward the ramp.

Percy placed the pieces of the fork together so she could visualize how it failed. "Sometimes, I feel like a submarine is just a very very complicated bicycle."

"That's fucking ridiculous," said Bastian.

"Seriously. In a way at least. They are both mechanical devices that operate within certain constraining physical parameters."

"You could say that about any fucking machine." Bastian pointed out.

"Bear the fuck with me! ...Both submarines and bicycles have to move through three dimensional mediums: up, down, left, right, pitch, roll, yaw..."

"Bicycles pitch?" Bastian asked.

"Absolutely they do: up and down hills. Though I guess they only yaw in a skid."

"I do enjoy a fishtail skid," said Bastian.

"Well, I think that's what I'm really getting the fuck to," said Percy, "it's that with both machines I find a kind of pure fuckin' pleasure from the mechanical handling of them while I move the machine through their element."

"You mean like a mouse on a wheel?" Asked Bastian, sucking at a freshly-lit cigarette while he watched Gregory cruise slowly back up the length of the cargo hold.

Percy smiled, "well, why not? Who ever said the mouse isn't totally fucking enjoying their time on their fucking wheels? Maybe if you put a wheel out in the woods, mice would come from miles around just to run on it."

Bastian scoffed. "I guess that's why you're the fucking captain. I don't find I get any fucking pleasure from riding a submarine. It's just a fucking job."

Hemi took his leave, pointing out that poor Cassandra had been stuck up on sonar and he would relieve her for a bit. A few minutes later Cassandra appeared and they explained the solitary bike "racing" rule to her. She selected a small sturdy children's bicycle and carefully pedaled down the cargo hold, without daring to tackle the ramp.

Then they heard a hiss of water through the piping that ran along the side of the cargo hold and the deck tilted slowly downward beneath their feet. Hemi had let some water into forward trim tanks. The cargo hold deck took on a ten degree down angle.

Each of them selected a bicycle and used the slope Hemi had given them to get a lot of speed down the length of the cargo hold. With some trepidation and false starts, each of them eventually tried a jump off the ramp, some landing more successfully --- and more dryly than others.

Gregory displayed an uncanny ability at bicycle handling. With the deck angled, he was able to pull his bike into a wheelie while skidding the rear wheel along the wet grating. He even managed to maintain enough speed doing this to still jump the bike when he hit the ramp.

They circled up and back repeatedly. With the boat otherwise completely shut down it was pleasantly quiet other than the ticking spin of pawls, and the occasional echoing shout followed by a metal-on-metal crash followed by laughing.

Bastian, after breaking his first bicycle, selected a second one that was more upright that he could ride with his thin limbs somewhat less cramped and folded. He slowly pedaled up and down the cargo hold while chain-smoking cigarettes. He rarely touched the handlebars as other shots past him.

Cassandra was very timid on the way down the slope, squeezing the brakes and skidding the whole way. She only tried the ramp once, and found the landing terrifyingly rough. But she could beat them all back up the slope with a high-speed spin and a surprising show of strength in heart and lung.

They raced on for the better part of two hours, until not one of them lacked a spot of blood running freely from somewhere on their body and a number of bruises as badges to prove the amount of fun they had achieved. There were no serious injuries other than a sprained ankle on Gregory's part that would set him limping for the next week.

Eventually, when the whole crew was looking like it had run out their physical capacities, Percy had Hemi level the _Prospect_ and then released them all to their bunks or coffee depending on individual preference for the rest of the day. 


[//]: # (### Into the garbage gyre)

When the clock indicated that it was fully dark up above the waves, Percy had them drive the _Prospect_ up to the surface. Hemi and Shakes got the _Gnat_ disconnected and surfaced. Soon both boats were running parallel to each other across a black sea of modest swells. The sky was loaded with heavy clouds which brought with them a steady breeze to drive the swells against the boats. The clouds made the night very dark, so much so that while it was easy to hear the _Gnat's_ diesel engine off to the starboard side from the bridge of the _Prospect_, it could not be seen out there in the blackness, except for the occasional spark of fire that escaped from the exhaust pipe.

They kept a steady eastern course, moving deep into the central ocean. With both boats running their diesel engines they could sustain high speeds. They kept up a steady 15 knot average, covering the vast distances of the open ocean relatively quickly.

Percy rode up on the bridge. Given the extreme darkness, she decided to forego putting a lookout in the ring. She had never felt like she had all the crew she needed to run the boat effectively, but having lost Gregory and Chips she was feeling more pinched than ever by too-few hands.

With no visibility on deck, and the sonar nearly useless over the volume of sound the diesel engines dumped into the water, the only real visibility Percy had was on radar. So every 20 minutes she had Cassandra turn on the radar for a few sweeps to make sure the ocean remained clear in front of them --- and that nobody was tailing behind.

For the first few hours of the night they settled into the monotonous drudgery of cruising. Gregory was in his rack, Cassandra listened to heavy noise in the sonar headset, Percy stared into the darkness from the bridge, and Hemi and Bastian stared at the wall of unmoving dials in the control room.

Toward midnight, Hemi climbed tiredly down to the sonar station, and tapped Cassandra on the shoulder. She did not even look up, knowing that this was Hemi's signal that it was time to turn on the radar unit. She leaned over and flipped the switch and the green light of the radar flashed across the scope and then swept slowly around showing nothing behind or to the sides, except for the lone blip of the _Gnat_ to starboard.

But as the radar passed to the front of the _Prospect_ it laid down a sprinkling of green glowing dots, like fireflies above an evening field, that slowly faded away until the sweep came around a second time and lit them all up again. A few of the dots were only a mile or two ahead of the _Prospect_. Further away they increased in density to a number that could not be quickly counted.

"Hemi, what's that? It looks like a fucking fleet!" Said Cassandra, her eyes going wide and reflecting the green glow of the radar display.

"Hmm. That is not alright. Bastian!" Hemi called up to the control room. "Throttle back to five knots... and shut down the diesels!"

A few seconds after, the sound of the diesels died away, Percy arrived in the sonar compartment having been directed there from above by Bastian. "What the fuck is going on Hemi?"

He pointed to the scope as he adjusted the second sonar headset on his head. "We are going to give that strange pile of radar contacts a listen."

Percy flipped off the radar. "Let's not give away our position more than we already fuckin' have. What do you think, should we dive?"

"I don't hear anything Captain Percy." Cassandra interrupted. "At least, not above Shakes' engine."

"For fuck's sake. Ping him." Percy ordered. "We need Shakes to shut down, and he might respond to a ping."

Hemi reached over Cassandra and pressed the ping button on the active sonar. A second later the unit lit up.

"The active unit is showing dozens of contacts _underwater_ as well as on the surface." Cassandra kept one hand against the sonar earpiece. "Shakes did shut down --- I still don't hear anything though. It's completely silent now."

"It is extremely unlikely that there is a fleet of dozens of ships and subs just floating without engines running," said Hemi. "Something else is going on here..."

In the sonar compartment they could hear Shakes' voice crackling questions over the ship-to-ship in the control room and Bastian responding to him.

"I suggest we make our friend Shakes a resource." Hemi said.

"Send the reckless risk-taker to check it out? That's my kind of fuckin' plan Hemi." Percy climbed up to the control room and took over the conversation with Shakes from Bastian. She explained the situation to him and they came up with a plan where Shakes would move forward on battery and check out the radar contacts while the _Prospect_ submerged to periscope depth and followed behind, staying within ship-to-ship range of the _Gnat_.

15 minutes later, the _Gnat_ was coming up on the first of the radar contacts. Percy watched the blackness where the _Gnat_ was located ahead of them through the periscope. Soon a beam of light shot out from the water, and in the reflection of it she could see Shakes' spiky head at the top of the sail of the _Gnat_. Shakes ran the light beam forward and back along a black wall that road up and down on the ocean swell ahead of him.

At this range Cassandra could hear the object on the sonar --- water slapping against a steel void with the random regularity of ocean chop --- Cassandra was convinced it was a ship. 

It was only a few minutes later that Shakes confirmed her guess over radio. "Yeah _Prospect_, the object is a big empty cargo vessel. Rusting away and half sunk, it looks like. You think all those contacts are abandoned ships?"

Percy looked away from the periscope viewfinder at Hemi, who was holding the ship-to-ship radio mic. "What do you think Hemi?"

"It is possible. I have heard rumors of such things: abandoned ships and garbage float into some kind of slow gyre in the middle of the ocean, where they sometimes circle for decades before they weaken enough for the ocean to draw them down."

"Like a fucking ship graveyard," said Bastian.

[//]: # (Is the garbage gyre the Zone from Stalker? Abso-fucking-lutely! But is not everything the Zone?)

"A walk among those lost souls might be an fucking opportunity for a pair of boats that don't want to be found," said Percy. "Hemi, see if you can work out a way with Shakes that we might traverse this graveyard safely."

Hemi and Shakes chatted for a few minutes over the ship-to-ship. They decided that if they kept the speed of the boats low, they should be able to navigate through the sea of derelicts safely. 

The _Prospect_ surfaced and they pushed forward at three knots. The _Gnat_ took up a position 100 meters or so behind. Shakes kept the _Gnat's_ diesel off as he followed in the _Prospect's_ wake so he could keep in constant contact with the _Prospect_ over the ship-to-ship.

[//]: # (Does the ship-to-ship work with the diesels running? Lets say yes, but a much more limited distance.)

At first, Cassandra was able to steer them around the big pieces of flotsam using the sonar. Since the ocean was very quiet, she could hear the sound of the _Prospect's_ diesel engines bouncing off the bigger floating pieces. But soon they entered an area so densely packed with wrecked ship hulks that they needed to use the active sonar to chart their way precisely through it. They started pinging at regular intervals a few minutes apart, and Cassandra would report obstructions ahead --- both above and below the surface. Hemi noted her reports on a clipboard and worked out a safe route forward. 

Captain Percy ran a power wire up to the bridge and connected a hand-held spot light. She swept a beam back and forth, scraping away at the heavy blackness in front of her boat. Most of the contacts Cassandra was seeing with the sonar were partially or almost entirely submerged, held aloft over the 1000 meter deep ocean by clinging to the last desperate bubble of buoyancy they yet retained from when the ships were alive. Under Percy's light the vessels were typically a low, black, curved, and oily form, riding threateningly just under the surface, awash with waves that passed over and obscured them. Alternatively, they would take the figure of a low wall in the water, still showing the distinctive outline of the pointed form of a ship hull.

As they made their way further, the debris in the water grew more abundant. The breeze they had been driving into earlier died away and the ocean flattened out, as if held down by the thick greasy blanket of refuse laying on it. In among the larger debris pieces of the derelict vessels were rafts of rotting wood from ship decking and furniture: rusting barrels, bits of foam covered in bright cloth, frayed lines, pale bleached buoys and bumpers, and pieces of masts and tools. Anything that might fall from a ship or get tossed into the ocean and did not immediately sink seemed to have made its way to this huge gyre of refuse. The larger pieces bumped eerily against the hull of the _Prospect_ with deep resonant thumps that could be heard throughout the boat. In many places an iridescent oily sheen sprinkled with clumps of floating grease reflected back in Percy's light.


[//]: # (### Through the dense part of the garbage patch at night; then in the morning they dive, and Cassandra hears the pursuing sub)

They spent the entire night slowly pinging their way through the densely polluted surface water. The _Gnat_ followed dutifully behind. Percy instinctively was feeling uncomfortable about the racket the two ships were making, especially since every ping told anyone within a 10, maybe even 20, mile radius precisely where they were. And of course even at a near-idle, the _Gnat's_ diesel --- which Shakes was now running again --- growled loudly with sympathetic vibrations reflected back from the abandoned ship hulls surrounding them. Captain Percy reassured herself that they were far off any routine shipping lanes, and most vessels would steer around this patch they had plunged right into. This patch that was more and more appearing to be quite a massive obstacle to make one's way across.

The boats were still on the surface and Percy was still standing on the bridge of the _Prospect_ when the morning sun eased itself up over the eastern horizon. Its long red rays ignited the landscape of black hulks around them until it looked like boats were stirring the dead waters of an underworld lake of blood.

As the sun crept upwards and its light filled out the entire spectrum, the lake of blood turned into a turbid and viscous black sea --- all the bunker fuels, engine lubricants, solvents and greases; all the specially developed chemical mixes that drove or eased the movements of the giant steel machines through the water --- all eventually escaped from the rotting containers that held them and contaminated the clean water of the middle ocean. The contaminants floated on the surface, coating and binding together the more physical refuse. The stuck-together grime coalesced and joined forces with larger pieces that floated to defy the power of the perpetually sucking bottomless hole underneath.

By the full light of day Percy felt far too exposed. She waved down Shakes until he stopped the _Gnat's_ engine and Hemi could contact him via radio to tell him to bring the _Gnat_ underneath and mate with the _Prospect_. This was fine with Shakes who had not slept the entire night, and looked forward to taking a rest aboard the much larger and relatively luxurious submarine.

With the _Gnat_ attached, Percy had the _Prospect's_ diesels shut down, and they submerged to 20 meters. It was much quieter underwater with no noise but the gentle hum of the electric motors. But they continued to send out a ping every ten minutes or so with the active sonar to avoid the submerged wrecks, which occasionally hung bow- or stern-down hundreds of meters into the water.

Between the active pings, Cassandra could now see a picture in her mind of the complex seascape around her. The sound of the _Prospect's_ motors refracted out and away around her, and came bouncing back from the heavy surface and reflected off larger pieces that bobbed around them. She spent the first few hours of the morning scanning around herself in circles with the sonar and flipping filters on and off. She was continually fascinated by the images of the underwater landscape that were drawn in her mind by the sounds the sonar put into her ears.

When she felt like she had found a good combination of filters for giving her the clearest view of the water around them while taking out the source sound of the _Prospect's_ motors, she did a slow sweep in every direction, scribbling notes on a pad as she went. Towards the rear port side she thought she could hear something oddly mechanical, making its way from far off through the dense medium of the contaminated surface water. She adjusted her filters and tried to pin it down, but it eluded her. It may have been the distant thrum of a motor, but it also could just be pieces of garbage grinding against each other. The sea was so full of signals and reflections that it was impossible to be sure what was real and what was just a acoustic mirage.


[//]: # (### moving through the garbage patch the next day, confirmation that the sub with the ram is following them again)

Throughout the day they slowly proceeded through the refuse gyre. Their active-sonar pings spread out and lit up their surroundings for Cassandra. She continually faced her own doubts: about her ability to detect objects in the water, about the directional guidance she was suggesting to Hemi and Percy, and about that occasional far-off machine noise that suggested the possibility to her that they might not be alone in the garbage patch. But every time her doubts came up, Hemi asked her to set off another active-sonar ping, and each of those pings would come back with such a concrete depiction of the water around them that her doubts would melt away along with the fading sound of the ping.

By the end of the day, Cassandra's confidence was rapidly growing. Sonar was becoming second-nature to her. She would close her eyes, and her mind would travel out into the water. It would be all blackness at first, but she would relax and open her mouth slightly to minimize the sound of her own breathing. Her heart rate would slow. Her mind would go out searching in the water. Without opening her eyes she could turn the directional wheel, and she found her mind could follow the direction as if she were seeing out through the microphones. She no longer need to look at the directional indicator to know whether the mics were oriented to the front, sides or rear of the boat, she just _knew_. The black pitch of the deep sea fell away, and in her mind it would all light up around her with a midday brightness that was entirely contained within her small skull. 

With confidence came a love of her job, and the long shift that Percy was currently asking her to do without breaks seemed like less of a burden than it had at first. She found time passed rapidly when her mind was out there in the sea of sound.

By the clock, it was just after dark when Captain Percy suggested they might want to move up to periscope depth and have a look around at the garbage patch. The _Prospect's_ batteries were about half discharged and if it was safe to run on the surface, they could run the diesels and recharge the batteries as usual. She asked Cassandra to have one last listen before she started raising the boat. Percy shut down the motors entirely so Cassandra could hear as far as possible.

In this complete silence Cassandra swung the sonar mics slowly around 360 degrees, listening to the sounds of the ocean in every direction. Into this complete silence that soft far-off motorized sound came again as the mics came around the rear of the boat.

Suddenly all her doubts came flooding back, and Cassandra felt her ears go warm inside the headphones. She instinctively _knew_ that motor off in the water was the sub with the ram, still behind them, still pursuing; perhaps never having left. She also knew instantly that she should have known it was the sub with the ram when she heard the first faint wavering contact hours ago in the early part of the day. She realized she had made a mistake, potentially a large one, and that made her afraid to say anything.

She listened to the sound for a few minutes, only just barely easing the directional wheel back and forth across the signal, trying to lock in on the strongest bearing for the signal. It was only when Hemi put his heavy hand on her shoulder that she realized that he had been standing behind her watching. Even without hearing he was capable of reading the gauges and knowing she was on something. Cassandra looked up at him. She wrestled down her fear about the mistake she had made.

She slipped a headphone off one ear. "Something's there Hemi."

"It does look like it, does it not?" He said. "Let me listen." He picked up the second headset and adjusted the volume. He paused for a second, the flipped a couple of filters on and listened again.

"That's them, isn't it Hemi?" Cassandra asked. "I... I think I heard them earlier."

Hemi nodded as he patted Cassandra's shoulder again. "Sylvia!" He bellowed upwards as he stepped backwards, stretching out the wire of the headset. He looked up through the hatch to the control room. 

Percy was squatting on her haunches, her face a meter above Hemi's. "What the fuck is it this time?"

"The sub with the ram... it is back again."

"Sweet motherfucking fuck! How fucking far away are they?

"The contact is faint and far off. That is why Cassandra did not hear them before." His eye caught Cassandra's grateful face. "They are far enough away that the active ping is not returning a distance to them --- or at least the active unit can not sort it out from all the other refuse in the water."

"But the pinging we've been doing has probably been leading them along through this garbage patch I fuckin'  mistakenly believed would provide us cover --- like fucking breadcrumbs through some fucking black forest. I know I've said it before, but I can't fucking _believe_ that fucking _ugly_ fucking boat is _still_ after us!"

"_Round Good Hope, and round the Horn, and round perdition's flames..._" Hemi said quietly to himself.

But Percy heard him quite clearly. "Oh, so the _Prospect_ is the fucking white whale now?"

He looked up at her. "You must admit, there is almost a kind of classic literary insanity to his actions."

"You stifle that fucking tendency of yours toward layered meanings expressed through overwritten symbolism right now Hemi. The Ocean is plenty fucking dramatic enough without having to spread some kind of pretentious icing of bullshit modern literary sludge on top of it. ...Alright, are they gaining on us? How long before we have to start worrying about them putting a torpedo in the water?"

"No way to tell just yet. They likely have the same difficulty as us --- moving fast through the surface garbage puts them at risk of hitting something."

"On the other hand, they have a giant fucking ram mounted to the front of their fucking ugly-ass sub. Perhaps they have no fucking fear at all of plowing through all this heavy shit. With that in mind --- we run like the fearful fucking bitch-offspring we are. We remain submerged! Bastian, seven knots. Fuck! No, wait. Gregory --- first go find fucking Shakes and get that leaching boat of his detached from my _Prospect_."


[//]: # (### They are pursued through the night)

20 minutes later there was a clunk from the depths of the _Prospect_ as the _Gnat_ detached. Bastian eased the throttle forward slightly and the _Prospect_ responded with an increased hum. The difference in speed was not significant, and most of the crew did not detect their increased velocity through the water. 

But Percy could. To her it felt like her boat was now tearing through the deep, and the terror of what may be hanging down from the surface directly in the path of her boat made her break out in a cold sweat that did not evaporate in the damp cool air of the control room.

For the first half of the night, they kept up the active pings. Percy traded the assurance of a clear path for the fear that each ping almost certainly allowed the sub with the ram to continue to track them. 

As the night wore on though, Hemi and Cassandra's careful measurements of the strength of the sub with the ram's sonar signal suggested the _Prospect_ was not going to sneak away while the pinging was going on. In fact, it seemed they might be losing ground.

The hours droned by with unvarying regularity. Hemi and Cassandra felt their minds softening with the persistence of the white noise in their headsets. While Percy desperately needed her crew, she also could not have them making bad decisions from lack of sleep. So after midnight she insisted that Hemi and Bastian hit the rack, with Cassandra and Gregory scheduled for a few hours rack time later in the night. She had no intention of sleeping herself.

When Percy inspected the page on the clipboard next to Cassandra's sonar unit she found it was rapidly filling up with notations describing the objects the active sonar was reflecting back, and the signal strength of the sub with the ram. Percy willed the _Prospect_ on, trying desperately to get the numbers to add up to some more distance between herself and that dogged signal out there in the water. But the numbers eased ever closer together, and she knew it was only a matter of time before the sub with the ram would be in torpedo range. That sub's commander must have known it too, because he did not increase speed, preferring to slowly reel his target in with minimal risk to him own boat. Given how quickly he had jumped to taking risks to gain an upper hand on the _Prospect_ in the past, the patience the sub with the ram's commander was currently showing telegraphed to Percy an unnerving amount of confidence he had in the coming demise of her boat.

When Captain Percy came down to the sonar compartment in the middle of the night to check on the contacts, Cassandra showed her that the list of signal strengths had steadily increased with the closing of their pursuers. Percy broke out in another cold sweat --- this time from the fear of the torpedo that she now realized could be released at any second. The sub with the ram was now rendering clearly on the active sonar readouts --- it had crept within ten nautical miles.

Almost regretting it as she said it, Percy asked Cassandra to lay off the active pings and use only passive sonar to track objects in the water. It would be challenging given the density of objects in the fouled water they were moving through, but at seven knots the _Prospect_ was putting out just enough noise that a good sonar operator should be able to see clearly the surrounding seascape for miles in every direction. Hemi's faith in Cassandra's natural skills was rubbing off on Percy.

With the active sonar off, Cassandra soon reported that the sub with the ram had slowed and was losing some distance. Captain Percy knew exactly what the cause of that was --- they had to run slowly and more silently to hear the _Prospect's_ engine noise now. Discontinuing the active sonar pings felt like the right move to Percy.


[//]: # (### They hit an obstruction in the water)

For the next two hours Cassandra blearily focused on listening to the sonar contacts and shouting potential hazards she heard in the water up to the control room. Gregory and Percy were required to constantly make adjustments to their course to avoid one large object or another that rang out in Cassandra's earpieces. But she could not hear the smaller objects, and every so often one would bump threateningly against the hull, loud enough for them all to hear it regardless of which part of the ship had been struck. Every time this happened Percy shouted a string of curses down to Cassandra, and every time it happened the oaths were fiercer and lasted longer.

By the time Hemi arrived back in the sonar compartment from his rack, Cassandra was clearly frayed. He consulted with her briefly to get caught up. He realized he would need to relieve Cassandra and let her get some rest. But first he wanted to check in with Percy, so he climbed up to the control room. 

While he was on the ladder, the crunching sound of an impact --- a recapitulation of the sound they all heard the first time the sub had rammed them --- shook the _Prospect_ bow to stern.

"Gregory! Reduce speed to two knots!" Percy shouted almost instinctively. As the boat slowed, Percy's next thought was that they had in fact been rammed again --- that Cassandra had not heard the sub with the ram charging at them. "Cassandra you little shit! You let them hit us!"

"No Captain Percy!" Cassandra wailed with the deep-grained panic of someone who knows they had made a mistake, "it definitely wasn't them! They're still miles and miles off."

Percy looked down at Hemi, who still clung to the ladder, his huge stone form held by tense-hard muscles. "Hemi, you get that little fucking whore off my sonar immediately and tell me what the fuck is going on with my boat!" 

Hemi slowly lowered himself to the deck of the sonar compartment, and nodded to Cassandra. She stood, wobbly on her feet, and handed him the sonar headset. Hemi looked towards the hatch that led to the crew quarters and Cassandra followed his eyes, first with her own eyes and then her whole body. She disappeared silently below decks.

Hemi put the sonar headset on and listened closely for a minute. "It was just a derelict... Cassandra was right, the pursuing sub is still close to ten miles behind us."

"She still fucked us Hemi. A competent operator would have fucking heard that derelict coming on."

"She was just tired Sylvia. She had been at the sonar station for nearly 20 hours. You or I could have made the same mistake in that condition."

"I can't use her in critical fucking situations, Hemi. It's too fucking risky."

Hemi did not reply.

Bastian was climbing up through the hatch into the sonar compartment when Gregory reported to Percy that the _Prospect_ was losing buoyancy in the bow again. Percy had already known it through the feeling of the angle of the deck against her feet, but the thought had yet to register itself in the conscious part of her mind.

Percy looked down and saw Bastian standing at the foot of the ladder up to the control room. "Bastian, get up here. Gregory, before you hit the rack, go down to the fucking cargo hold and check on our welded split in the pressure hull --- fucking money is that it has opened up again with that last little tussle."

A few minutes later Gregory's voice came crackling over the PA radio in the control room. "Fuck Captain Percy, you're right. Those welds are failing. There's already about a fucking foot of water in the bilge."

"Fuck me!" Said Percy. She leaned over the trim control panel and flipped on the forward bilge pumps and slid the power controllers up to maximum. As the bilges ramped up, the higher-pitched hum of their small but powerful electric motors passed through the hull and lay down on top of the bass hum of the main drive motors. Bastian looked up at Percy with a doubtful look, but didn't express his doubt verbally.

"Sylvia," Hemi's voice floated up from below, "whatever hope we have of the sub with the ram not tracking us is gone if you are going to run the bilge pumps."

"Well, we're not going to fuck around with sinking again Hemi. I've had too many fucking close calls with getting sucked down the hole recently. We'll just have to figure out some other fucking tactic."

For the next few hours Hemi carefully tracked the pursuing sub on sonar. He grew ever more sure that they were back on the _Prospect's_ track and were gaining ground once again. Percy nervously watched the battery gauges as the needles dipped slowly down into the areas marked with red cross-hatching. The relatively fast speed they had kept up now combined with the added draw of the bilge pumps to leave them with terrifyingly little battery power.

Captain Percy had run out of ideas though. She just let the _Prospect_ run, leaning her weight from an overhead strap while she smoked. Hemi continued directing Bastian to make occasional adjustments to steer clear of dangerous objects in the water.

It was just starting to seem to Percy that perhaps there were fewer calls up from Hemi for course adjustments when the needles on the battery gauges suddenly dipped down into the solid red zone and then fell onto their zero needles, flat and lifeless. The sound of the electric drive motors died away with them. And just a second after that the higher pitched whine of the forward bilge pumps died away too.

The _Prospect_ sat dead in the water.

Bastian nervously reached up and tapped the battery gauge, a smoking cigarette propped between two long fingers on a shaking hand.

"Hemi!" Percy called down. "We've completely run the fucking batteries down!"

Hemi removed the sonar headset and stood at the foot of the ladder to the control room. "What do you want to do now?"

"I'm fucking asking you: what the fuck can we do? All we've got is hotel power! ...And We're going to fucking sink if we don't have power to run those forward bilges. Give me options!"

"You could flip over the main power to draw from the emergency hotel batteries --- but with the bilge motors running, they'll deplete those batteries in a matter of an hour or so."

"No," said Percy. "That leaves us with no maneuvering. Give me another option."

"We could surface of course. Though we will never lose them running diesels, and it is almost daylight now," said Hemi.

"Of this I am fucking aware. But I think that's what we're fucking doing because at least we'll be fucking moving. How much garbage is on the surface?"

"There is still a fair amount of coverage, though I do believe we have passed through the densest mass of the garbage patch now."

"And how far behind are our fucking malformed pursuers?"

"Fewer than ten nautical miles."

"Shit. Ah fucking well. Up we go boys! Hemi, want to let some air into the main ballast?"

A few minutes later a loud hiss pushed through the boat as Hemi opened up the compressed air into the main ballast tanks. The _Prospect_ rose slowly up until it bobbed with its deck awash at the surface.


[//]: # (### They run diesels on the surface, with the bilge pumps --- noisily)

Percy popped the hatch and climbed up to the bridge under a still-dark sky that was just beginning to lighten in the east. The oily water was still black around them and bits of floating refuse and wood lay across the deck and in the water, but there were distinctly fewer of the large shadowed ship hulls in the dimly visible sea around about. 

In the pre-dawn light Percy scanned around with a pair of binoculars, and not seeing anything of note on the first pass, she circled around the horizon a second time. There was nothing out there to see except the gray gradient field of the sky meeting the black field of the water.

She called below and a minute later came the familiar whine of the compressed air turning over the diesels. The engines fired and a chugging black smoke rose from the top of the sail behind her. She could almost feel the power flooding back into all the systems of her boat that depended on it as the big diesels spun their turbines. 

The _Prospect_ picked up speed and the low-pressure air system soon had pumped enough gas into the ballast tanks to fully surface the boat, stranding big chunks of refuse on the now-dry deck.

Percy put Bastian in the lookout ring and had Hemi take over at the controls of the boat. She piloted herself, constantly scanning ahead of them, and sometimes yelling a small course correction down to Hemi.

In half an hour the eastern sky they moved towards had lightened but the western sky behind them still pursued them with a dense blackness. With no crew to listen to sonar, they had no chance of hearing the torpedo that slipped into the water behind them. They did not know it was there until the percussive sound of an explosion caught Percy and Bastian in the back of their heads. They spun around to find the source and a glowing ball of orange was lifting slowly up from the surface a few miles behind them, a central point of sparkling and glowing orange light that reflected the oily sheen and the shadowed chunks of refuse back at them.

"Fuck," said Bastian quietly.

"What was that?" Hemi called up from the control room.

"They put a fucking torpedo in the water after us!" Percy shouted in response. "Looks like it hit one of the derelicts."

"This is not going to work Sylvia. They are just going to get closer and try again," said Hemi.

"I fucking know!" She lit a cheroot and sucked at it for a long time, the lingering petroleum smell in the air blending with the harsh tobacco smoke as it made its way into her lungs. "OK. Fuck. Bastian, keep watching."

Percy climbed down to the control room, and flipped off the diesels, had Hemi throttle the boat back to zero, and powered down the bilge pumps.

"To take a chance on firing from that distance, they were counting on the fact that we were making so much noise. We just got fucking lucky that there was a big steel target between us and them for the torpedo to find." 

She pulled on her cheroot and stared blankly for a minute.

"Without the bilges we will not remain long on the surface." Hemi broke her reverie to remind her of the other impending danger they faced.

"Go wake up Gregory and sic him on welding the fuckin' seam back together again. We'll risk taking on water until he gets the leaking slowed. Are we still in touch with Shakes?"

"He checked in over the ship-to-ship maybe ten minutes ago. He should still be in range." Hemi said as he was climbing down the ladder.

Percy pulled down the ship-to-ship mic. "Captain Shakes, are you still out there?"

"Captain Percy." Shakes voice came crackling back. "Nice to hear from you. I heard that fuckin' explosion and I thought for a second you were on your way down the fucking hole."

"They put a fuckin' torpedo in the water, but all they got was one of the derelicts. Listen, we're going to make like a derelict ourselves and shut everything down over here. I need you to try to confuse the situation, or they'll just fucking come right to the point where they last heard us. Make some noise, would ya?"

"That's what I fucking do best these days," said Shakes. "I'll totally throw some fucking chaos and confusion into the situation. Right?"

"Fuck right. Out."

A minute later the _Gnat's_ engine started and Percy could hear it without aid through the hull of the _Prospect_ though it was a quarter mile in the distance.

Hemi returned and reported that he successfully got a stumbling and groggy Gregory headed down to the cargo hold to seek out the welding gear. Percy put Hemi on sonar with a mandate to give detailed reports on the sub with the ram's location --- as soon as the _Gnat_ had moved far enough off to be able to hear anything.


[//]: # (### The Prospect hangs out silently on the surface while the sub with the ram searches)

Percy spent the next few hours in the control room sitting in the dive planes control chair and smoking one cheroot lit off another as the cargo hold once again took in sea water and the bow of her boat slipped slowly further down into the water.

Hemi would call up a report from sonar every ten minutes or so. The first hour passed quickly with Hemi's reports describing their pursuer's continued movement towards them. But Shakes' slow, noisy run off to the southeast seemed to have worked, and the sub with the ram adjusted its course to follow him. They were moving steadily away from the _Prospect's_ location.

At least at first. But in another hour, Hemi's reports made it clear that their pursuers were now familiar with the tactic of using the _Gnat_ to draw them off. The sub with the ram gave up the chase to the southeast and started to move in large slowly-searching circles. They returned to using active sonar. The pings once again loudly echoing through the hull of the _Prospect_ every ten minutes or so, penetrating through the consciousness of every crew member.

By the third hour, the fear of being found started to convert into a somewhat safer feeling that came with the monotony. It was clear that the active sonar pinging was not helping the pursuing sub sort through the mass of contacts that echoed back to find the _Prospect_. The sub with the ram gave no signal that it would leave off its diligent search, but Percy began to feel more and more confident that unless they were spotted visually, the _Prospect_ could continue to play the part of the proverbial needle while the sub with the ram dug through the haystack.

After hours alone in the empty cargo hold standing in reeking bilge water, Gregory finally put his dripping and stinking head into the control room to report to Percy that he had successfully stanched the substantial part of the leaking. She reached over and patted his head, and then wiped her palm on her pants. By now the bow of the _Prospect_ leaned down about five degrees. She opened a couple of valves on the trim tank control panel and let water flow into the rear trim tanks. The stern sank slowly down until the boat was level. This left the _Prospect_ at a depth where the deck was under water, but most of the sail was still dry. Percy figured floating the boat slightly deeper could only enhance the perception that it was another derelict.

[//]: # (5 degree slope on a 300 meter ship puts the bow... how far under water? Is five degrees dramatic enough here?)

Long hours of this stagnant situation turned into even longer hours. While Captain Percy believed that the most important quality in a submariner was the ability to put patience above all else, she also knew that not taking action was a kind of action. In many cases the right move for a submarine was to simply hide and wait. It was the thing a submarine was best at --- and in this world of discreet shipping this was the reason so much cargo now crawled across the face of the globe underwater. But the success of using hiding as a technique obviously depended entirely on having a reasonable chance of not being found. Percy's intuition told her that while they were safe for the moment, it was only a matter of time before their chances of not being found decreased to virtually nothing. She was confident the commander of the sub with the ram would intuit the same conclusion.

# 2. The _Gnat_


[//]: # (### Surfaced)

The _Prospect_ rose slowly. It tilted a little on one axis then the other as Captain Percy adjusted the trim of the tanks. But more or less the boat rose straight up, since they didn't have the motors running and it was being lifted by buoyancy alone.

Percy and Hemi watched the depth gauge slowly roll itself backwards, up past their test depth, up into what Percy would normally consider safe operating depth, then periscope depth, and then the sail broke through the surface. Those in the crew quarters could feel the boat bob like a cork to the surface, and at that they let out a small cheer that echoed up to the control room from the depths of the boat. They arrived moments later at the bottom of the ladder up to the control room, obviously expecting to go out on deck.

At first, Captain Percy was not even going to think about allowing that. Years of experience had reinforced the routine that the first action on surfacing a sub was to scan around with the periscope, if not the radar. There was always a chance that the only safe move was to dive right back down. But she fought back this instinct within herself -- there was nothing on the surface that could be more dangerous than attempting to dive her damaged boat again. She looked down at her crew -- minus Chips -- and waved them up through the control room.

Owen, with his scrawny youthful energy, led the way and charged up the ladder, struggled with the tightly closed and somewhat rusted hatch-seal wheel for a moment before squeaking it open, and pushing the hatch up with a pop as the slight variation in pressure equalized.

Daylight poured down through the hatch into the control room below. With it came cool air in motion. It was air that smelled of the open sea instead of the stench of warm human bodies, oil, and diesel exhaust. The crew followed Owen out onto the bridge of the sail.

It was a cool, breezy day. Gray clouds hung low overhead, and there was a mild chop on the water. Owen hopped over the fairing and down the rungs on the side of the sail to the main deck and ran up and down it shrieking like a small child. 

After a few minutes of just enjoying the surface air, Percy got back to the situation at hand. "Hemi, you were looking at the charts: who controls this part of the surface these days?" Percy asked.

"Umm, perhaps the Western Federated Socialists? At least, they did the last time I looked at a Territorial Authorities map. But that was more than a year ago."

"Those assholes are bad fucking news, and have no tolerance for surface transports -- even ones that have papers," put in Bastian. "We should not stay here."

"We would be on our way right fucking now... if we had any fuel or power." Said Percy. "That lovely sound you hear of gentle waves smacking against our hull is the sound of a ship not moving. We're dead in the water, and we're still a bit fucked folks."

"Owen!" She called down to the deck. "Come back up here, we have to get back to work." As he ran over and climbed back up the side of the sail she laid out their next steps. "Hemi, get down to the navigation chart and see if there's any hope of any place we could limp to with what little  charge we have left on the battery."

"Bastian, get on the radio and see if you can raise anyone on the Independent Operators frequency. Maybe we'll get extraordinarily lucky and find some help from someone who won't ask too many fucking questions."

"Or try to sink us," Bastian added.

"Ya. If you do raise anyone, for fuck's sake don't talk to them -- don't tell them _anything_. Just come get me and I'll try to gauge their reliability myself."

"Sure Capt," said Bastian.

"Gregory... I'm fucking starving, want to see if you can get something going in the galley?"

"Sounds good."

"And put a new pot of coffee on too. The shit in there now has been on that burner so long it looks like bunker fuel."

They climbed back down into the control room, but left the hatch open and for the next few hours a blessed breeze blew down through, and occasional tendrils of sea air reached as far into the submarine as the crew quarters.

[//]: # (### On the radio)

Inside, Captain Percy joined Hemi at the navigation table.

"The most pressing problem," said Hemi not even waiting for her to ask, "is the batteries are basically gone. Even running extremely judiciously, we have a range of a few nautical miles at best." He used a compass to draw a dotted line around their position showing what was within range. It was a completely barren section of the chart in the middle of the ocean. It was nowhere.

"Not even close huh? Well, that just leaves us with the less than ideal option of accepting help from someone."

"Most who pass in these neglected waters are not much inclined to help those they do not know."

"We'll just have to hope we don't meet most folks then."

She took a couple of steps back to look up through the hatch into the control room and see how Bastian was doing with his effort to achieve that goal. He had one stick-like arm up in the air, adjusting some dials on the radio mounted in the ceiling of the control room. His other hand held the mic that was attached by a curling cloth-covered wire to the radio. He was giving out mayday requests on a couple of different frequencies known to be monitored by other independent shipping operators like themselves -- both legitimate cargo haulers and smugglers. Those frequencies were also often monitored by Authority vessels that might be engaged in policing shipping and transport traffic through their control areas. 

"Anything Bastian?"

"Fucking nothing. Nothing good or bad. This is one voided piece of open ocean you raised us in."

"Alright. I'll check sonar and radar. Maybe someone's listening who just isn't interested in responding."

She stepped over to the sonar station lifted the headphones over her ears. Without bothering to sit, she turned the directional control wheel with one hand, slowly back and forth, scanning for the sound of anything made by humans. One nice thing about being dead in the water was they were not making any noise themselves. She could hear even the small waves against the hull of the _Prospect_. It was a rare pleasure to have such clean and clear sound on sonar. But for all that silence, there was nothing to hear.

The passive sonar was safer to use than the radar because it did not send out any signal that could be detected. You just listened with what were essentially underwater microphones for the sound any other vessel might be making. It also had the advantage that it could be used while submerged. Radar on the other hand could only be used while they were on the surface, and it sent out a big loud radio beacon that could be seen by any other ship with a radar unit -- basically all of them. If there were any ships out there, the signal would bounce back to the _Prospect_ and they would know the location. But any other ship in range could detect the radar signal and also know the precise location of the _Prospect_. Generally when Percy used radar, her habit was to dive soon afterwards.

In this case she thought turning on the radar was worth the risk. But the radar sweep rolled twice around the display showing a completely empty scope. There was nothing for miles in every direction. She left it scanning and eased herself into the sonar station chair and tried to get comfortable.

For the next few hours she chain-smoked and listened to the emptiness of the ocean around them on the passive sonar. It was a mind-numbing task trying to pick out a signal from the muted hiss and rush that came to her from the choppy surface. She swept the sonar mics in a circle covering every direction out from the _Prospect_ and back again. Having not found anything, she would then begin again. The continual effort at maintaining her attention on the search butted against the complete lack of any signal to focus on or track. She was beginning to think the best move might be to go check that they had enough food and water supplies to survive weeks of drifting on open ocean.

Except then, way off their rear port side, a very soft throbbing came into her headset. She closed her eyes. It was faint and threaded, like the last heartbeats of a leviathan. She opened her eyes and glanced at the radar sweep, but it remained completely clean.

She called Hemi over. "Listen to this, and tell me what you think it is."

Hemi had exceptional ears for sonar. He stood next to her and put the headphones on and his eyes lost focus as he listened. The tips of his thick brown fingers rested on the top of the directional control wheel and eased it back and forth across the contact's heading.

"Very small surface craft, and moving... unusual though -- and not just because it is tiny and in the deep ocean. It seems like it has almost no hull sound. I do not hear any wake running along it."

"Can you calculate a range?"

"It is close. Let me see." He looked at the dials of the sonar unit and scribbled some numbers on a scrap paper. "2 nautical miles, thereabouts maybe? I think you should be able to see it with the periscope."

Percy nodded and climbed up into the control compartment. She raised the periscope up and spun it around to the bearing of the target. She rolled the scope barrel slowly back and forth along the horizon line, where the dark gray of the water press-fit up against the light gray of the sky. With the _Prospect_ on the surface, and the scope up, she could see something like ten nautical miles on a clear day. This was as good as vision ever got on a submarine.

"Even if it were a fucking canoe... at two miles away I should be able to see it." There was nothing but unblemished gray fields in her scope. She double-checked the bearing with Hemi, shouting down to the sonar station below. 

She was pointed in the right direction, there was simply nothing there. 

She had a hunch though. She felt confident about the sonar target. She was sure something _was_ there despite the fact that underwater sound can sometimes play tricks. The lack of any visual on the surface narrowed down the possibilities of what it could be.

"Hemi," she called down again to the compartment below, "I want to motor over closer to it. Keep tracking it on sonar."

Captain Percy put Bastian back in the rudder/throttle control seat. She gave him a heading towards the sonar target and they put the electric motors in gear. Her eyes locked on the battery gauge, which waved slightly as the motors started turning, drawing the last amperage from the depleted battery banks. The needles on the battery gauges were deep in the red now. There was such a very little gap of air between them and the zero mark. They would only get one shot at this.

[//]: # (### Ship-to-ship)

They crept -- two nautical miles an hour. After a quarter hour or so, Hemi called up from sonar, "We got lucky Sylvia. I am tracking something like an intercept course -- it is headed towards us at any rate. At our current speed there is no way we would ever have caught them if the object were heading away from us. It is moving fairly quickly. But..." There was a gap, and Percy could hear him scratching a pencil on paper. "But, we need to go slightly faster, can you do four knots?"

Percy sighed. It did not sound like much, but it was twice as much power consumption. "You heard the man Bastian, give her a little fuckin' gas."

There was a burning cigarette between Bastian's bony fingers as they wrapped around the throttle and eased it slightly forward.

A few minutes later Hemi called up, "Good. We will be within a quarter mile of it in a matter of minutes."

"They must be able to fucking see us. They haven't changed direction or speed?"

"No. They must not be looking, or they just do not care."

Captain Percy stayed on the periscope, slowly tracking across the bearing. Still nothing.

"Sylvia!" Called up Hemi. "They are gone. No detectable signal on the sonar."

"Stop the boat Bastian." The electric motors were very quiet when running this slow, but she wanted Hemi to have total silence for listening. "What was the last range Hemi?"

"About 500 meters. They are super close. I have to assume they are just sitting out there. We could ping them?"

"Ah, that would scare the fucking shit out of them. They might think we were armed and about to fire on them. We're trying to make friends here. ...I'm going to try ship-to-ship radio. We're just close enough they might hear us, and the radio could be a little less threatening."

Percy reached over her head and flipped on the ship-to-ship radio. It wasn't really a radio, it was just acted like one. It used the sonar rig to push sound through the water to talk to other ships nearby. 500 meters was just about the limit of its range. Real radio transmissions were supposed to follow a set of protocols and rules, potentially enforced by agents of Authorities in their respective territories. Ship-to-ship had no rules other than an informal argot that had developed partially to obfuscate meaning for any other ship that might be listening, and partially just evolved from nautical cultural habit.

[//]: # (Is the ship-to-ship radio actually a 1970s trucker CB? You fucking know it.)

Captain Percy took down the mic from the radio and brought it to her lips. She pushed the transmit button, and the needles on the radio unit's gauges jumped to show how much power she was transmitting with. She whistled a series of five randomish tones into the mic, and let go of the transmit button. The power needles died back to zero, and there was silence for a minute or two. 

Then she repeated the transmission of the tones. Another minute passed.

Then a crackly male voice came over the radio. "I see you over there, you hulking ugly gray fuckin' submarine. And I guess you know I'm here. Why are ya sittin' on the surface, and what ya want with me?"

Percy hesitated, and then transmitted back, "well, first let me state flat out that we're nothing but a cargo sub -- and let me emphasize: un-fucking-armed. Second, we've been severely damaged, and swam through an icy hell to get back to the surface. We're out of fuel and extremely low on power. Long and short is that we're in some desperate need of help, and you are the only contact we've seen in these fucking desolate waters."

Another moment passed. "Yeah. Well. These waters are empty because the Authorities running this territory right now are a bunch of tight-sphinctered class-A holes who seem more interested in shooting down transports than letting any commerce commence. It's a fucking bad place to be not moving and on the surface."

"Not moving is hardly typical for us. What are you sitting on there? We don't see any ship in the scope. Any assistance you can offer would be much appreciated."

"Ehh, I'm not one who is much for offering assistance, so for the next few minutes here I think I'm not going to show ya what I'm riding. But if yer telling the truth, I don't envy your dire-ass situation."

"I absolutely understand your unwillingness to not tip your hand. Anything I can do to reassure you we aren't anything other than what we say we are?"

"The territorial Authority motherfuckers around here generally just shoot first, check papers later. They're not much for mind games. So the fact that you haven't already shot at me says a lot." 

There was a long pause of radio silence. Percy held the mic off-angle in her hand while listening. She began to worry that she had lost their only chance for help.

The ship-to-ship crackled back to life. "Alright. I think I can risk pulling alongside ya, and poppin' the hatch. Don't send nobody onto my boat without my say-so, or I'll dive straight out from under ya. Fucking' got it?"

"We'll look for you -- for something -- off the port side. Out."

[//]: # (### Shakes pulls alongside)

"Hemi," Percy called down to sonar, "we've got ourselves something, though I'm hardly sure what. You and Bastian come up on deck with me."

Bastian unfolded his long skinny legs from a cramped-looking position where his feet were propped up on the control panel. He climbed up through the hatch and via the ladder to the bridge of the sail with Percy and Hemi following. The wind was blowing a little harder and the chop had kicked up. Bastian cupped his hands and lit another cigarette. Percy and Hemi shaded their eyes, scanning the water. It was a few minutes before they saw a small gray oblong object cutting through the choppy little waves. It was a tiny submarine sail, no more than a meter long and high, with a couple of thin wispy antennas trailing from the top in the wind. Unusual for a submarine, it had a small viewport in the front of the sail through which the pilot could look. At the rear of the sail a stream of diesel smoke floated up and away behind it. The deck of the tiny sub was totally awash, running just under the surface of the water.

As it got closer they could see the big splotchy patches of rust all along the hull of the mini-sub, and a slight oil slick of a trail that it left behind in its minimal wake. Bastian, Hemi, and Percy climbed over the fairing of the sail of the _Prospect_ and down to the deck. Standing here, Percy was somewhat sickened to see the angle of the deck and the bow of her boat sitting much lower in the water than usual, still weighed down by the tons of excess ballast water.

A moment passed before a hatch opened at the top of the sail of the mini-sub and a head of a man with spiked yellow hair emerged. His arms were still inside the sail working controls and he was standing propped on something inside so he could get his head up high enough above the fairing to see as he guided it alongside the _Prospect_. 

Bastian opened the hatch to a wet-storage locker on the deck and pulled out some large white rubber bumpers that were flat and deflated after being subjected to the pressures of underwater. He connected each to a short hose that led to a fixture for the low-pressure compressed air system inside the wet-storage locker, and let a little puff of air into the bumpers until they had been restored to more or less their normal shape. Each bumper had a long line that he tied off to recessed deck cleats and lowered down between the two subs.

"Toss a line!" the guy in the sail yelled as he let the engine run on idle and stepped over the fairing. He was wearing tall rubber boots as he ran up the washed deck of the small sub. The boots were pulled over leather pants that were originally probably black, but now were cracked and gray at the seams and joints. From the left side of his broken leather belt hung a couple of sizes of adjustable wrenches, the finish on the them beat away, matte and rusting in places from years of banging against each other like chimes. He wore a faded black denim vest from which the sleeves had been inexpertly removed leaving stray threads of denim trailing behind him in the breeze and exposing a pair of sinewy arms.

Bastian, still with a cigarette between his lips, threw across a line. The sub pilot made it fast to a cleat in the hull of the mini-sub, and then repeated the move at the stern. He nimbly leaped across to the hand-holds on the side of the _Prospect_ and climbed up the curving side to the deck.

[//]: # (### Intro Shakes)

He looked around with a nervous twitch, and then motioned to Bastian for a cigarette, who cupped his hand and lit it off his own before handing it to him.

The man took the cigarette in a hand that shook slightly when he reached out, and brought it to his lips and sucked long and hard at it. "Ah fuck thanks. I ran out a couple of days ago. I go by Shakes." He held up his hand level in front of them and they could see it tremble slightly in the air. "Ya can see why." Shakes looked at Hemi standing just ahead of Percy with his black beard wafting in the breeze. "You the captain?"

Hemi nodded toward Percy. She stuck a grimy hand out. "Captain Percy. Hemi here is my submersible giant and Deck Boss. The skinny one is Bastian."

"That the whole complement?"

"Few more below." Percy was still staring at the mini-sub, "that's a hell of a fucked-up craft ya got there."

"Like it? I built it my fuckin' self. Welded it together on the top of a mountain coffee farm from rotting scraps of metal. They had a bunch of land higher up where the coffee don't grow, and it seemed like a good place to build a boat. It was. Cept it wasn't a good place to launch a boat from. Getting it down to the water was way more difficult than the buildin' of it."

"I could imagine," said Hemi.

"I've heard of this kind of thing," said Percy, "the boat runs fast and just below the surface. Basically invisible to any kind of radar, and too quiet for most sonar. Good for... small shipments?"

"Aye, 'Specialty shipments' -- when stuff has to be got somewhere fast with no fucking questions asked. Just not too much stuff. I also built in a few special modifications -- this here boat is the fastest and most versatile in its class!" 

Hemi looked at the rusting bulbous hulk alongside and doubted there was any class of vessel that would accept it. 

Shakes continued, "most of these homemade jobs just run at the surface; I added some batteries and some trim tanks, and this here boat, the _Gnat_ is the name, can _dive_. Run a bit under water, just enough to get away from any curious onlookers."

"How deep?" asked Hemi.

"Maybe 30 meters on a good day. You don't have to go very deep to hide in something so small."

"How fast?" Hemi could not deny his curiosity now.

Shakes grinned. "Faster than this fuckin' barge." He said kicking the toe of his rubber boot against the hull of the _Prospect_. 

Percy frowned. "Welp, that's an impressive submersible hobby you got there. But has anyone here got an idea how how we're going to get my boat moving? You ain't carrying a load of diesel fuel are you Mr. Shakes?"

"Captain Shakes, if you fuckin' please. And I certainly ain't got fuel to spare. And I can't say what I _am_ carrying, ceptin' that I can't see how any of it could help you. Still, if I can do anything to assist, I'm game -- at least if there's a little something in it for me. I'm pretty convinced y'all ain't some Authority ruse, and we smugglers gotta stick together, I fucking say."

"We're not smugglers," said Percy, her eye firmly locked on Shakes. "We're independent logistics operators."

"Ain't we fucking all!" said Shakes. "Honestly, I ain't got much in the way of ideas for ya. I was thinking maybe you was the smart ones. From what I can see y'all are fuckin' fucked. Best I can say is I could run into my destination port and send some friendly bigger boat back out for ya. But that'll probably take a couple days at least."

[//]: # (### Shakes agrees to let Hemi aboard the Gnat)

"In a couple of days we'll either be sunk or in some Authority holding cell. There's gotta be a better option. Hemi?" Percy looked up at at him.

"Well, nothing immediately comes to mind. But that is with limited information. If a new option has arisen, it will be aboard the _Gnat_. But to sort that out, I would have to get in there and take a look at what resources you have got aboard. I'm not sure how willing you are to let me do that."

Shakes did not say anything, but pulled on his cigarette and watched the exhaled smoke quickly blown out over the water by the breeze.

"Look, we aren't the type to ask for help, and I hate imposing on other folks' business, just as I don't want 'em imposing on mine, but you can see we're more than a little desperate here. If you can see your way to allowing Hemi -- and just Hemi -- aboard to take some specs of your boat -- see if you're carrying anything he can use -- we'll make it up to you later. ...At the current moment about all we can offer you is hot food."

Shakes eyes brightened at that. "Hrm. Well I've been eatin' nothing but cold chow straight from the can for days now. A hot meal is a strong offer yer puttin' on the table there. Alright. This big guy, and this big guy alone. And he don't look at nothing I don't want him to look at. And he don't get answers to questions I don't want to answer. No fucking pushin', right?"

"No pushing," said Hemi.

"Right. Hang back a minute, let me go look around in there first, make sure all my pornography is put away. When I give you the signal, come across."

Percy grinned as Shakes lowered himself down the side and leapt nimbly over the dangerous gap between the two boats where the chop occasionally ground the two walls of rusting steel against each other, crushing the breath out of the cracked old bumpers between them. He disappeared into the sail hatch of the _Gnat_.

"Interesting character," said Hemi.

"Solo operators... nobody who is comfortable spending days or weeks at sea alone -- eating cold canned food, no fucking less -- ever totally has their head screwed on right. Anyway, it doesn't matter how pleasant a person he is. The question is, do you think there's anything you can do with that boat that's going to help us?"

"I am not entirely hopeful. It is not much of a craft, and is not likely to have much in the way of resources aboard. Frankly, I am surprised he is not lost and dead in the water himself."

"Find us something Hemi. But don't do anything to set that tweaked motherfucker off while you're over there."

"I shall be like a lamb among the lions."

From the sail of the _Gnat_ Shakes' head and arm popped up and gestured. "Come on over man-mountain. Mind the fuckin' gap!"

Hemi's size made for a thrilling thing to watch as he hopped the crunching span between the two boats, but he proved just as nimble as Shakes had been. Hemi was wearing heavy but conventional leather boots, and the water washing the deck of the _Gnat_ was soaking the lower part of his legs. The tweed pants of his suit turned a dark and sagging color. He stepped over the open hatch into the sail, and from where Percy was watching, it seemed for a moment like there was no way his bulk would get down that tiny hole. But Hemi lithely disappeared into the boat.

Percy gave Bastian a pull on the sleeve, and he tossed a smoked-out butt into the ocean before they climbed up the sail and back inside the _Prospect_.

"So what do you think? Ain't it the finest fuckin' boat ya ever had the pleasure of dropping inside of?" Shakes seemed genuinely proud.

"It's certainly a masterpiece of the genre," replied Hemi, even more evenly than usual.

Hemi had spent nearly his entire life among and inside filthy machines, but he had never seen anything where the grime lay down quite as thickly as this. There was literal garbage all over the deck: empty cans rolling back back and forth with the swell, candy wrappers, and various greasy machine parts. A big open tin that had once contained herring served as an ashtray but seemed like it had not been used for ash but merely as a target to toss used butts at -- most of which had missed and lay scattered about. 

There were stacks of pornography -- Shakes had not bothered to hide any of it. Or at least Hemi hoped that was true, because the stacks on display were of a class so deviant that Hemi could not imagine what Shakes would have deigned to feel needed hiding.

In one space, recessed between the supports of the pressure hull, were columns of food cans still unopened. The labels had been peeled off and the contents written on them in grease pencil. Most appeared to be of some variety of highly-salted pasta-and-sauce. In another recess was a bin with what must have been a hundred different types of puzzle games that all had the basic premise of requiring squares of color to be sorted alike. Every single last puzzle was solved. 

[//]: # (Shakes is some kind of idiot-genius. And also has a lot of time on his hands.)

The controls to the sub were aligned with and partially inside of the sail. Hemi noted that the controls were airplane-style: with a single yoke that controlled both the angle and direction of the boat -- a pretty sophisticated system for any submarine, but particularly a hand-built machine.

The sail was the only place with enough headroom to stand upright. Or, at least Shakes could stand upright there, Hemi still had to crouch a bit. Through an open hatch leading forward, Hemi could see small wooden crates crammed into the bow section. More crates were arranged behind the controls located in the middle of the boat. Shakes had thrown what were clearly his sleeping blankets over the crates. There was still a thin heavily-stained mattress to one side, which Shakes was raising to lean against the pressure hull so there was enough room to pass the crates.

"Y'all woke me from a nap with the fuckin' ship-to-ship call. That's why I didn't see ya earlier. I suppose you want to see the engines and batteries and what-fuckin-not? They're toward the back." Shakes reached into his denim vest and withdrew a leather pouch. He pinched some dried leaves from it and stuffed them into his cheek and masticated them slowly.

[//]: # (Shakes chews coca leaves --- he got into them building sub on the coffee farm in the mountains.)

"Yes, the engines first if you please." Hemi squeezed past the crates and pulled a small notebook and pencil from an inside pocket of his tweed jacket. The engine was massive and took up the entire rear third of the boat. Now Hemi was genuinely impressed. "That's a lot of engine for such a small vessel."

"Took the thing out of a fuckin' tractor that had been broken down and rustin' in a coffee field for years. Had to build a gantry and borrow another tractor to haul it up the mountain to where I was building the _Gnat_ and get it installed. Direct-drive to the prop, so it's a genuine ship engine, not just a glorified generator to power an electric motor."

The configuration was obvious to Hemi. The greasy steel drive shaft came straight from the back end of the diesel running along the center-line of the boat and passed out through the stern, like an egg on its side, pierced by a needle.

"But you said it has batteries too, the boat can swim underwater?"

"Sure, the direct-shaft drive means I've gotta have a transmission of course. I worked with a mechanical genius who lived on the coffee farm to build this fancy-ass transmission that lets me switch over to that electric motor to drive.  It's a fuckin' hassle though, I try to avoid it, 'cept in emergencies. I have to leave the controls and come back here to the engines, switch out the diesel and manually engage the electric motor with these levers. And the electric motor is small -- it's slow; though fuckin' silent as a sunken graveyard."

"It is the finest piece of mountain-top engineering I've ever seen on the sea," Hemi said honestly. 

Shakes grinned.

"And the batteries?"

"Eh, Batteries, fuel, ballast tanks are all below these deck panels. You have to pull them up to get at them. Since I rarely use the electric motor, the batteries almost always have a full charge on them -- as they do right now -- if that helps somehow. Obviously not enough juice to power your giant fuckin' washtub over there."

"No, not nearly. How much fuel do you have?"

"Wellsir, this is how we check that..." Shakes slipped his finger through a metal ring atop a pipe that ran upward from the deck along the curve of the wall. He pulled a long wavering piece of thin steel from the pipe and wiped it on a foul rag that hung on a hook on the wall. He replaced the dipstick and then quickly pulled it back out again and held it up for Hemi to see the graduation along the dipstick.

Hemi winced as he caught an acrid whiff of petro-chemicals off the dipstick. "You buy decent quality fuel oil Captain Shakes?"

"Ah well fuck, you know Hemi: I buy whatever I can get at the trading posts. I'm sure they're sometimes selling chunky bunker with the used oil from the cafeteria deep fryer dumped on top. But ain't that what the fuckin' fuel filter is for?" Shakes kicked at a rust-flaked cylinder mounted on a pipe running back towards the engine. "I consider it good quality fuel if I don't hafta siphon water out of the bottom of the tank after a top-up." 

"Indeed. And how long will that amount of fuel oil you have there last you?" Hemi asked, pointing the eraser side of his pencil at the dripping dipstick Shakes was still holding between them.

"Maybe twelve hours worth left. Enough to get me where I'm fuckin' going."

"Where are you going?"

"I think I'm gonna keep that bit a' information to myself for the moment." Shakes set the dipstick back in its pipe.

Hemi made a sound in his throat while he scribbled some calculations. He pointed to a gauge in front of the control yoke, "is that the battery charge?"

"Such as it is. That's salvaged from tractor parts too. It shows me roughly how much charge is left on the battery, but mostly it's just got a fuckin' little red light that comes on when the batteries are about to kick off. If ya want any fuckin' precision, you gotta get down under those deck panels with the meter and take readings off each of the battery banks." Shakes kicked a small steel door that opened to a recessed cabinet in the wall. He pulled from the space a short pry bar and a small metal box with a dial gauge and a pail of electrical leads dangling from it. "Check this shit out." He levered the teeth of the prybar under the steel deck panel. Hemi stood on the other side and they lifted the panel together and propped it up.

Below were rows and rows of what Hemi was almost certain were lead-acid truck or tractor batteries. A rat's nest of greasy black cables ran back and forth between them.

Hemi scratched his beard. "Welp. Let me see that meter." He lowered himself to his knees and reached out over the battery banks with the leads from the meter. He began touching the probes to various terminals on the batteries and writing down the results he read off the meter in his little notebook. "This is going to take a while."

"Always fuckin' does." Shakes took a comb from his pocket and dipped it in a bucket half-filled with oil that dripped from the diesel engine. He ran the comb through his hair, then teased it back up to a spiky randomness with the tips of his fingers. He wiped his fingers on his shirt. "So... where were _you_ guys headed, before the whole fuckin' dead-ship thing?" 

Hemi didn't look up from his work. "Captain Percy has been playing that particular piece of information close to her chest since we left the last port. I believe she has a line on our next job, but she has not yet shared details with me," Hemi said somewhat tentatively. He continued silently checking the status of the batteries while Shakes pulled a pack of cigarettes from his vest and lit one to chase down the flavor of the leaves he had been chomping on.

After Shakes had filled up the small space with a haze of tobacco smoke, Hemi sat up straight and stashed his notebook and pencil back in his pocket. "I think I have enough information for the time being. That food Gregory was working on is probably ready. Shall we go see if we can find something hot to eat?"

"Shit ya. My gut is a gaping hole. Help me get this panel back in place though." Shakes tossed the remaining pinch of burning cigarette in the direction of the ashtray and Hemi helped him replace the panel.

[//]: # (### A meal aboard the Prospect)

Shakes and Hemi came into the galley of the _Prospect_ with Captain Percy and Bastian already crammed into the tight seating around the table. Gregory was working a giant cast iron pan at the stove that was so heavy with frying rice that the wiry muscles of the arm controlling the pan bulged with the effort of shaking it.

[//]: # (Would they have a gas range on a sub? Or would it be electric. If electric, would they waste power cooking food? Maybe we shall just leave that little tidbit unaddressed.)

Gregory looked up when Hemi and Shakes came in. Hemi introduced Shakes.

"Fuck yeah," said Shakes eyeing the pile of frying rice, "I ain't eaten nothing but cold canned pasta for more than a week."

"None of your canned garbage food here, Captain Shakes," said Gregory, grinding the pan back and forth across the range in a way that set small sparks flying. "Gotta keep it moving or it'll burn to the bottom. This is real fucking submariner's food. Everything good that can't go bad: rice, eggs, cabbage..."

"Are you putting that foul slimy-gray pickled cabbage in the rice again Gregory?" asked Bastian, "you'll be killing submariners if submariner's food is that fucking real."

Gregory huffed. "My ol' pap worked a submarine galley in the wars. He used to say 'if you can heat it, you can eat it.' And this shit's gonna be plenty fucking hot." Gregory dumped in an entire container of the questionable pickled cabbage, and stirred it around as the sound of frying drowned out any conversation. This process only lasted a few minutes more. 

"Captain Shakes, for helping us out, you're up first." Gregory cracked an egg onto a smoking smaller frying pan next to the giant one full of rice. As it sizzled on the creosote surface, Gregory dumped huge piles of rice into a big bowl and handed it to Shakes. The rice was browned by the black salty sauces Gregory had poured into it, and burned to a crusty-black crunchiness in places. Steaming bits of cabbage slithered throughout, flecked with red and black pepper. Shakes was about to dig a fork in when Gregory slipped the fried egg on top with a spatula. Its white was stained an oily, slightly-gray color, and the glowing orange yolk was held in place by a wiggling skin on the edge of being burst from the pressure of the hot liquid inside.

Shakes grinned before plunging the tines of his fork into the yolk and letting it run into his rice. He then started working his way into his bowl with an uninterrupted shoveling motion of his fork from the bowl to his mouth.

Gregory served up the rest of the crew the same way. Captain Percy asked him to run up to the control room and get on the PA and tell Owen to come up for some grub.

Hemi sat at the end of the table with his little notebook propped open in front of him, eating his rice with one hand while scribbling down calculations with the other.

Their hunger got the better of any conversation for a few minutes as the mounds of rice, egg, and cabbage steadily vanished. Gregory served himself and sat down, and got back up a few minutes later to fry another egg for Owen when he arrived. A few minutes after that, he had to get up to make Shakes another egg. All told, every one of them had at least two servings and Owen and Shakes each ate three servings apiece. Gregory never got to sit for more than a minute. And when no more eggs were being demanded, he got up again to put coffee on.

Between forkfuls of rice, Captain Percy tried to get an assessment of the situation on her boat. "Owen, have you been down in the cargo hold?" Owen nodded, his crop fully loaded. "How's the patch looking?"

Owen swallowed, and then swallowed again. "I'm hardly an expert on welding or repairs, but I'd say it looks pretty bad. The patches are an ugly mess, and I'm pretty sure the water level is rising again, though more slowly."

"Can you work on it? Can you clean up those welds, get the leaking stopped?" Percy asked.

"I can try. But you know it's delicate work that I'm just starting to figure out. There's a chance I could just make it worse -- burn a hole right through the hull. If you're asking me, I think you need Chips on it."

"I didn't ask your opinion you little shit. I asked if you can fix it." Said Percy, aiming her fork at him.

"Yeah, Captain Percy. No fuckin' sweat." Owen poked at his food a little less hungrily.

"Finish your food and get your skinny ass back down there."

"Sylvia," Hemi said, not looking up from his food. "I really think you need to do what you can to get Chips back to working on those repairs."

She pounded the table, and looked up, breathing through her nostrils. "Fuck."

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
‚Åü

[//]: # (### A plan)

Owen took his coffee to go, and headed towards the cargo hold to try and reinforce Chips' patches. When there was finally a cup of coffee in front of the rest of them, and the empty bowls pushed into the middle of the table, Percy brought them to order. "Next agenda item: assuming we don't fucking sink, how do we get my lady moving again?" She looked at Hemi.

Hemi put his pencil down. "Perhaps in your time on the sea some of you became familiar with the Angler fish? In some species the female is enormous compared to the male, maybe a hundred times bigger. The females are complex, highly evolved organisms, with sophisticated traps for catching and devouring other fish. The males are nothing but tiny sperm repositories. They swim around until they find a female, attach themselves to the female's underside, and then fuse with her body, essentially becoming nothing more than a sperm organ for her."

"Hemi, let's try stepping around the long-winded metaphor and get to the fucking point." Said Captain Percy.

"Here is what I propose," Hemi continued unfazed, "the _Prospect_ has a hatch with a mating collar on the bottom side of the boat. The normal intended use for it is underwater docking to another vessel's topside hatch. We could rig something so we could mate the _Gnat_ to the underside of the _Prospect_, and then feed up fuel and power into the _Prospect_ from the _Gnat_. As a male anglerfish might..."

[//]: # (So: why aren't they just transferring Shakes' fuel from the Gnat to the Prospect? I guess because then they would have to tow the Gnat behind them. And if it came to using the Gnat's batteries, they can't really transfer the charge over -- though maybe there's some complex way they could move the batteries over. I guess it does make some kind of vague sense to mate the two boats up. Also, being mated allows them to dive -- shallowly.)

"Got it," Percy interrupted, "and you think there's enough juice left in the _Gnat_ for... what? How far could that take us?"

"How far do you want to go Sylvia?"

"Hold the fuck on a second," Shakes cut in, "What exactly do I get out of your little biology lesson Hemi? The fundamental pin of this here plan of yours is really me casting my lot in with you loser a-holes. Basically you're turning my boat into a reserve tank, and I'm donating all my fuel to you. And maybe even more fuckin' 'gregiously than that: I'd be giving up the independent operator's _sacred_ right to self-determination. Suddenly I'm demoted from Captain of my own boat to rank-and-file in some back-water freight-trucking crew. What's the payoff for me? And it better be a whole lot more than a couple of bowls of fried rice, or I'm taking my boat and gettin' the fuck on my way. I mean, I thought I could just sell you some batteries or something and be on my way. But yer talkin' about something quite above and beyond my baseline generosity level."

Captain Percy blew out her cheeks. "OK look. First: you are not going to be crew, you are our _guest_ Shakes."

"_Captain_ Shakes," Shakes inserted.

"Our guest, _Captain_ Shakes. Second, I've recently made a contact that has put me on to our possible next job, and let me say gentlemen it is a downright fuckin' doozy when it comes to potential profitability. You throw in with us right now _Captain_ Shakes, and it's like you're making a good bet on a large payout in the near future. Assuming you're all done gorging yourselves, let's regroup at the navigation table and I'll show you what I'm thinking."

"Anything that profitable has got to be illegal," said Shakes as they made their way forward out of the galley.

"As you know, what is illegal in one territory is a high-value commodity in another, at least for most cargo," said Hemi.

"Oh, I wasn't judging; just, ya know, clarifying. Regional high-value commodities are the _Gnat's_ bread and butter."

They regrouped around the navigation table, most still holding their tin coffee mugs. "So where are we now?" asked Shakes between sips.

Hemi pointed to the obvious small x at the end of a string of grease pencil dashes.

"To pick this job up, we need to reach the destination I had been aiming for before we got side-tracked," said Percy, "and that destination is here." She pointed to a small feature on the chart with a grease-stained finger.
 
Shakes set his coffee mug down on the glass covering the chart and pulled down the retractable magnifier. He leaned over the chart and read the label of the feature Percy had pointed to. "It says, 'deserted.' That's where your big fuckin' score awaits Captain Percy? A deserted island?"
 
"It _was_ deserted when this chart was made. And the current residents would probably prefer the charts remain labeled that way. But over the last ten years or so, a small depot was built there. Look..." She took the grease pencil and drew a lightweight but long line across hundreds of miles of ocean. "The Territorial Authority boundary is roughly about here. With total assholes on this side we are currently on, and only sort-of assholes on the other. So you can see how it makes sense to put a depot on that deserted island just across the line to help facilitate trade in, out, and through Asshole-vania over here."

"The Authority on this side of the line _are_ a bunch of aggressive motherfuckin' assholes," said Shakes. "They must just fuckin' hate having that depot there."

"That's why the proprietors would prefer the island to generally be understood to remain 'deserted.' And it's also why the assholes patrolling the water we're currently in are particularly unfriendly dicks to good folks likes ourselves in the business of shipping. Hence my prerogative to get us moving again, and why we would be particularly grateful to have you assistance in that endeavor Captain Shakes."

"Well, when you put it that way -- that particularly profitable way, I mean..." said Shakes.

Hemi picked up a pair of calipers and measured the distance between the small grease-pencil x and the deserted island. "About 100 nautical miles..." he muttered mostly to himself. He set his notebook on the glass and scribbled calculations, pausing to take further measurements at some points. "We have to cut everything to the bone, but the math says we could make it. _Could_."

"Wait a damned second, I put it to you again: what do _I_ get out of this fuckin' mechanical monstrosity of a plan?" Shakes was stabbing his finger against the table, leaving smudgy black prints on the glass.

"I can pay you up front for the fuel we take from you today Captain Shakes," said Percy, "and at the depot I'll pay you your standard hull-load fee, plus refill your fuel oil. So it's like you're getting paid for a full shipping run just for accompanying us to the depot."

"You mean _if_ you get into that there 'highly profitable' line though don't ya? What if you find that fuckin' line has dried up?"

"In that case, we'll have to work something else out that is within our means. You afraid of a little gambling Captain Shakes?"

"What about my current load? This little fuckin' adventure of yours is going to set be back a couple of days at least. What do I tell my current client?"

"Where is your drop-off?"

"Well, I was headed for the Longland Islands trading center. Refuel there; and then on to my drop-off destination a few days out beyond that."

"Com'on buddy," said Bastian, "look at the fuckin' chart; it's nearly the same direction! There's no way the difference in travel time between this depot and Longland Islands is more than a day. You can tell your client you were delayed by any whatever-fuck-thing you want. Hell, tell them the truth. You're probably still going to be within your delivery window anyway!"

Shakes considered the chart. There was no arguing with Bastian's point though.

"Plus we will fit a nice mating collar onto the _Gnat_. You may find that to be of some use in the future," said Hemi, "think of it as a deluxe feature."

"And hot meals till we get to the depot," added Gregory.

Shakes looked up at Gregory at that, risking letting it slip that he might be bought cheap if the pay satisfied his stomach.  "I need one other thing though... I want you to keep a line open to me on any future job possibilities."

"What.. like fuckin' partners?" Percy bristled.

"Fuck no. I work alone. But an operator has to have connections in this game. You'd be a big cheese for me; feeding me future prospects. That way I get long-term payoffs for my investment in your sorry-ass fuckin' futures right now."

"Alright. Any job that seems suitable for a specialty cargo hauler like yourself, I will happily send your fuckin' way."

Shakes grinned. Now they were negotiating from a place he understood -- most profit is future profit. "So, ah, Hemi, what exactly are ya going to do to my beautiful boat?"

"Well," Hemi said, looking at Percy, "first, we need to rouse Chips. She is the only one on board who might know how to fit a mating collar that could work."

Percy was grinding her teeth. "Alright, Fuck. Hemi, go see if you can rehire Chips on a _temporary_ and ad-fucking-hoc basis to do some of this welding we need. I don't want to see her though. Tell her to stay the fuck out of my way or she'll find herself swimming in the prop wash... once we're moving again."

[//]: # (### They reconcile with Chips and talk about fitting mating collar to the Gnat)

Hemi loaded up another bowl of rice and led Shakes to the crew quarters where they found Chips in her rack with the curtains drawn. 

"Chips," Hemi addressed the curtain, "I brought you some food."

"Ah fuck you and your gestures Hem'," came a muffled voice from behind the curtain. "Go spoon it into that twat you work for until she fuckin' chokes on it."

"Chips, you are certainly tough, no one would deny that. And I think that toughness comes partly from a genuine mean streak in you, and partly from the fact that you believe you know how to do things right. The problem is that Captain Percy has both of those qualities too, so just like you she is both sometimes mean and also not going to be the one to admit when she did something wrong."

"Spare me the fuckin' you're-both-so-fuckin'-alike speech Hemi. Just fuck off."

"I am just explaining _why_ she is not going to come apologize, Chips. I am also going to tell you I believe she was entirely wrong, and risked your life by not warning you she was going to blow the tanks. You were right, and she _should_ apologize, but you know her -- she will not."

"So fuckin' what? You think I give a shit?"

"So I do not believe you want to die out here just because she is never going to do the right thing and admit she made a mistake. But that is what is going to happen: we are going to sink and die on this bleak stretch of ocean right here if you do not help us. We need you to keep the welds on that patch of yours together. Please."

There was a silence. Then a small, filthy hand stuck out from behind the curtain. "Give me that food, I'm fucking starving." Hemi put the warm bowl of rice into the hand, and it withdrew. There was a clinking of the fork for a minute, and then Chips opened the curtain a little so she could look at Hemi and talk to him while she ate. That's when she saw Shakes. "Who the fuck is that?"

"I'm fuckin' Shakes," said Shakes.

"_Captain_ Shakes," said Hemi.

"Is that your name or how you reproduce?" asked Chips.

"Like you're one to fuckin' talk. Didn't they call you 'Chips'?"

"Look," Hemi interrupted, "we found Captain Shakes here on the surface. He has a boat -- a small sub. I want to weld a mating collar onto the sail of his boat. It has to fit to the _Prospect's_ bottom mating collar. I want to attach his boat to the underside, and run with it that way. This is another project we cannot do without you. Think you could rig something like that?"

"Well fuck. I might have some scrap steel that could do that. Depends on what the hatch on his boat looks like, so I'll have to fuckin' eyeball that. Possible it could be done." She thought for a second. "But that's a fuckin' tricky bit of sonar listening to make that mating work, steerin' the boat up from underneath, like. You think you got the fuckin' skills to do that Captain Shakes?"

"I've squeezed that boat through any number of tight places -- narrow fuckin' gaps pushing through Authority anti-sub fencing and the like. I'm as good a sub pilot as there ever fuckin' was."

"His boat, The _Gnat_, has a viewport in the sail. He should be able to see enough to execute the mating maneuver without the aid of sonar," said Hemi.

"A fuckin' window on a submarine. Stupidest fuckin' thing I ever heard. Fuckin' crazy shit ya want to pull here. Look Hem', you're right about me not wanting to die out here. Way I figure it is to best push that priority forward, I gotta spend my time workin' on my fucking patch in the cargo hold. I may in fact spend the rest of my fuckin' life working on that fuckin' patch. I ain't got time to be up there fuckin' around with welding scrap steel onto what -- and I'm just taking a wild fucking guess here -- is some barely-afloat rusting sea-tractor." She paused. "You might get Owen to do it."

"The kid?" asked Shakes, "fuck that. If there's welding to be done, I'll weld my own boat."

"She is right though," said Hemi, "the patch in the _Prospect_ needs more work. If it fails, it could take both boats down. Before you do go back to your patch though Chips, get Owen and go out with Captain Shakes and take a look at the _Gnat_. Make sure they have what they need to get this done right. It is not going to help us much if the mating collar leaks and floods the _Gnat_. Have Owen haul up the spare welding rig." 

"Aye Hem'," she said, understanding that what Hemi really meant was she should instruct Shakes on how to do the job correctly. She swung down from her bunk handing Hemi her empty food bowl. "And fuck you for workin' around my bad mood by siccing me on a right mechanical challenge. Come on _Captain_ Shakes, we'll go find the fuckin' kid, and have a look at this boat of yours."

[//]: # (### Hemi and Percy put someone on radar)

Hemi found Percy sitting at the sonar station with the headset on, listening. When she saw Hemi, she pulled one earpiece off. "That go OK?"

"Yes. Shakes says he is going to do the welding on the _Gnat_, Chips wants to keep working on the _Prospect's_ patch."

"I'm glad she came to her fucking senses."

"Her senses had little to do with it."

Percy ignored that. "What's next?"

"I wanted to look at the chart and run my numbers again."

"Alright. We should put someone on radar, I don't want any Authority craft sneaking up on us."

"Put Gregory or Bastian on it." 

"Yeah. Alright, I'll get Bastian in here. Better than fucking nobody."

"Send Gregory out to help Owen and Shakes. Welding the mating collar on the _Gnat_ is going to be a something of a tricky operation."

"Right." Captain Percy climbed to the control room to rouse her crew on the PA..

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
‚Åü

[//]: # (### Back on deck, with the cargo hold hatch open, lifting the welding rig and welding the Gnat mating collar)

On the deck of the _Prospect_ Owen had raised the big cargo hatch, which opened a gaping hole down into the cavernous space of the cargo hold. Through the cargo hatch was the only way to get the heavy welding rig out of the boat. He had assembled a small tripod gantry over the hole, and from it he had hung a hefty chain hoist. Gregory was down in the cargo hold securing the end of the chain to a welding rig. When he had it ready, Gregory gave Owen the thumbs up.

"Hey Gregory," Owen called down to him, "while I'm hauling the welding rig up, take a look around: we still need the material for the mating collar. And get the gangway into position, I'll need it to wheel this fucking thing across to the _Gnat_. Also some heavy clamps, and a welding mask." Owen looked across at the deck of the _Gnat_ with the chop washing over it where Chips and Shakes were drawing lines on the top of the sail with a grease pencil. "Uh... better get those fucking rubber waders too." He lit a cigarette and started hauling the welding rig up, hand-over-hand. "This isn't going to be easy," he said to himself through the cigarette hanging from his lips. Each long pull on the chain only eased the welding rig below up a matter of centimeters as the lifting capabilities of the chain were both augmented and slowed by the wheels it looped through.

When he finally got the welding rig suspended over the deck, he gave it a little kick, and when it swung back he let the chain out and grabbed the rig as it touched the deck and tilted back toward the hole. This was really a two-person job, a mistake would mean a 10-meter drop into the cargo hold, and probably being maimed or killed. Doing the job of three people by yourself was typical of working on one of these always-understaffed cargo subs.

Owen wheeled the welding rig away from the cargo hatch and aligned its wheels with the deck of the _Prospect_ so it would not tilt off into the ocean. By the time he got back over the big open cargo hatch, Gregory had returned underneath with the gangway. Lashed to the railings of the gangway were the various other things Owen had asked for. Owen dropped the end of the chain down to him, and Gregory clipped it to one end of the gangway. "Hold on, I'll come up and help you haul it up." He disappeared toward the stern of the boat.

With Gregory helping to pull the chain through the blocks, they hauled the gangway vertically up to the mouth of the cargo hatch, out onto the deck, and got it lashed into place connecting the higher deck of the _Prospect_ to the low, wet deck of the _Gnat_.

[//]: # (### They plan the mating collar)

Chips waved Owen over. "Thanks for doing that fuckin' gangway. It'll be a lot easier getting back to the _Prospect_." She grinned her rarely-seen, wide-mouthed, slightly gapped-tooth grin at Owen. "Alright, look here, this is the plan Shakes and I got worked out, and ya should be glad Shakes is doing it. It's going to be a fuckin' nightmare if it works, and like a fuckin' wet, squirtin', languish in the head if it don't." She pointed to the top of the sail. "We fuckin' lucked out though, Shakes here built the sail fat enough that we can make the welds fuckin' flat. Ya just need a piece of steel cylinder of the right diameter, cut it even, then weld it around the hatch opening. And then weld those spare male docking clamps we got onto the sides of the cylinder."

"How am I going to get a cylinder the right diameter?"

"Worst fuckin' case you have to weld it together out of over-lapping curved pieces. But I think I might have a hunk of steel tube in the scrap pile left over from repairs to the mating collar on the _Prospect_ a while back. In that case we might -- if you're a fuckin' lucky sonof-uh-ho-ar -- have something exactly the right fucking diameter already."

Owen nodded. "And how're the docking clamps going to be activated?" asked Owen, "they're electro-magnetic, right?."

"Yeah," said Shakes, "we'll need to drill some through-hull fittings. That sucks, but it shouldn't be too hard to make them water-tight to 30 meters, which is what I usually call the depth limit of the _Gnat_. And if they do happen to leak... well, they'll be pretty small leaks. A boat that don't leak isn't a boat, it's like, a fuckin' airplane, or something."

"Since we're going to be dragging the _Gnat_ along by the mating collar," said Owen, "Seems like we should also weld some supports on the outside of the collar, down the sail, and directly to the structural elements of the hull. It'll be ugly as fuck, but less likely to leave the _Gnat_ ripped away from the collar." 

"Ugly-as-fuck is my other name," said Shakes.

"Listen to the kid, Capt Shakes. He's gettin' a fuckin' touch for this stuff," said Chips.

"Hey, offer all the advice you want, but I'm the one who puts the fuckin' torch to my boat, got it?"

"Good by fuckin' me. I'll leave ya stupid fuckers too it. I got my own welding to do." Chips gave them a casual salute and made her way along the gangway to the _Prospect_.

"I'll get Gregory digging through that scrap steel, see if he can find that tube she was talkin' about," said Owen.

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
‚Åü

[//]: # (### They weld the mating collar)

This was going to be an extremely tough job. Not as tough as welding the pressure hull back together under water like Chips was currently doing, Owen reminded himself, but nobody would do this job on the _Gnat_ if they did not have to. Owen had wheeled the welding rig across the gangway, and that had only been modestly harrowing. Lashing it to the sloshing hull of the _Gnat_ had been somewhat more so. Owen set Shakes up with everything he needed handing him tools one-by-one, like a nurse supporting a surgeon opening a consumptive rib cage.

The ocean chop was not horrendous, but it was enough that the _Gnat_ rolled back and forth under them. Owen had locked huge iron clamps in place that held the work material to the sail. The water washing over the deck would sometimes smack up against the sail and shoot up right where Shakes would be welding.

Shakes stood astride his boat lolling in the surface of the sea in the same way one might stand on a mountain top. He took a pinch of dried leaves from the pouch in his jacket pocket and stuck them between his teeth. He lit a cigarette, and put it to his lips. He leveled the mask on his head, and slipped the heavy welding gloves onto his hands. He picked up the torch, and standing straight up, opened his arms wide and closed his eyes. He took long slow breathes, gapping his lips next to his cigarette, and his breaths rattling a little with the spittle coming up to enzymatically dismantle the dried leaves. He cleared his mind, focused on his breathing. He felt the swell and rhythm of the ocean, the time of it marked out by the clink of the adjustable wrenches hanging from his belt. He called the gods of steady hands and perfect welds to him.

He opened his eyes, spit the remaining half of cigarette off into the ocean, leaned over, and flipped the welding mask down. 

And then proceeded to lay down the foulest, globbing booger-weld Owen had ever seen. Smoking masses of material built up on top of smoking masses, curled over, and gooped around in carbon-coated black curves. Shakes gripped the welding stick fiercely, the muscles of his forearms tensed up. The tip wavered back and forth across the line the weld was supposed to follow so that it looked like he might be trying to sign the work rather than repair it.

Shakes welded, went back over his work, and welded more. It grew uglier and uglier, globs upon globs of congealed molten metal. The wash of the sea continually soaked the two men in cold water. Every few minutes Shakes had to stop welding so Owen could move the clamps. Since the seam needed to be watertight, Owen wanted to keep it press-fit in place with the clamps at all times. Owen knew that that starting and stopping like that was bad for a welder who wanted to make a clean, strong weld. But since Shake's welds were about the worst he'd ever seen, that seemed like the least of his problems. The hot welds steamed when the water ran over them, which Owen was pretty sure would not contribute the strength of the weld.

"You... built this boat?" Owen asked Shakes, when he raised his head up for a break. 

"Aye fuckin' ya. On a mountain top."

"And... it doesn't leak... too much?"

"Ah well, ye know there's always gonna be 'nother leak. I just patch em and keep fuckin' movin'."

"Lot of patches?"

"Sometimes it seems like it's more patch than original boat. But then, since it was built from scraps, it has always been a fuckin' quilty kinda thing."

By the time they finished welding the support struts down the side of the hull, the new mating collar looked like a bipedal birthday cake, frosted by a toddler using a cancerous mixture of coke and pitch. 

"You think that'll hold?" Owen asked looking at the mess doubtfully.

"Ah hells ya. Look at how much material we welded into that thing! See, an engineer can build a thing to an exact fuckin' spec and -- if they're a real right good fuckin' engineer -- that thing will perform they way they expect it to, in all the situations they expect it to. The thing is, that don't mean it will perform in situations the engineer _don't_ expect. That's why I always _overbuild_ things, far beyond any spec -- so I'll be ready for what I don't expect."

Owen wheedled his way up and down following the thread of that logic, and eventually decided it made absolute sense. "Well, nothing like holding a welding project underwater and dragging it along at a few knots to test the quality of your work."

"Aye that's what we'll be fuckin' doing fer sure when once we got the _Gnat_ set up dragging under your boat over there. Why don't you go tell that big Hemi guy we're ready here."

[//]: # (### They lower the boat)

Getting all the gear from the welding operation stowed back in the cargo hold took longer than expected. The chop was building a bit, and that made doing anything aboard the _Gnat_ more difficult. Once Hemi saw all the odds and ends stowed below and checked the main cargo hatch seal, he went to the forward end of the cargo hold to see how Chips was coming along on her work.  She was welding yet more scraps of metal patches over the still-leaking wound in the pressure hull. Thankfully the water level was at least down enough that Chips was wading instead of swimming. 

Captain Percy came walking down the cargo hold and met up with Hemi standing at the water's edge in the forward end. Chips looked up when she arrived and glared at her, but went immediately back to her welding.

"We are ready to try this connecting up the _Gnat_ move," Hemi said to Percy when she stood next to him.

"Good," said Percy through an exhale of her cigarillo smoke. Her eyes were bloodshot and her entire face drooping and wane from lack of sleep. She had another cup of coffee in her other hand. "Need anything else from me when you try the mating?"

"I do not think so. But it will go much easier for Shakes if we can put the _Prospect_ in motion, and lower the deck under -- just run sail-up. At that depth the waves will have a lot less affect on the motion of the boat." 

Chips looked up from her work again when she heard this.

"Do we have the battery life left for that?" asked Percy

"Ten minutes at a creep speed maybe? I believe we can just manage it. I am more worried about whether we have enough fine control over the buoyancy to lower the boat just a few meters like that."

"But if we can run at sail-up depth, we'll also be also be a much harder to spot target as we head for the depot."

"Ah fuck ya both, ya weeping cunts!" Chips interrupted from where she was standing in the water. "Yer determined to fuckin' sink us! Are ya forgetting the high-pressure system is fucking depleted? I doubt there's enough fuckin' pressure left for a full blow if something goes wrong. Fuck -- there's probably also not enough fuckin' power in the batteries to bring us back to the surface with the fuckin' low-pressure system! We'll be lucky to fuckin be leapin' out the top of the sail as it lowers away under us heading for the fuckin' bottom!"

Captain Percy just stared down into her coffee cup.

"I agree, Chips," said Hemi, "it is dangerous. But so is running slow with engines blaring full-up on the surface if we manage to get the _Gnat_ attached. We would be a big fat radar _and_ sonar target. We need the advantage lowering the boat down will give us."

"Aye well, yer both fuckin' suicidal, and murder-fucking-cidal -- since yer trying to drag me down against my will. To lower the boat you gotta open the main fuckin' ballast valves, of course. What the fuck happens if they don't fuckin' close again though, eh? Then we are just letting all the fucking buoyancy out of the boat with no way to put it back."

"There is no reason to think the valves will not close." Said Hemi. 

"And you, Chips, will go double-check those devices our lives depend on before we try this operation," said Percy, her eyes grinding away at Chips.

"The fuckin' problem," said Chips, furious and exasperated, "is there's no fucking back-up plan -- no fail-safe, no redundancy. The boat works perfect like, or we all fuckin' die. Submarinin' is just too fuckin' dangerous for no backup-system."

"We are not disputing that Chips. But sinking is only one of the risks we face right now," said Hemi, as calm as always. "Go check the ballast tank valves -- make sure you are confident they will work they way they are supposed to. When you are happy with them Chips, let me know, and we will put the top deck underwater."

[//]: # (### Explaining the mating procedure)

Ten minutes later Chips climbed up into the control room and reported to Hemi, interspersed with much swearing, that the main ballast valves should work as expected, at least as far as her limited ability to test them without sinking the boat would allow. Hemi checked over the state of their batteries and other systems, and noted everything with a pencil on a clipboard. He got on the external PA and called Shakes to the control room.

Shakes' appeared on the bridge at the top of the _Prospect's_ sail. He looked down at Hemi through the open hatch into the control room and called to him.

"Ya fuckin' ready Hemi?"

"Just about. I need you to take the _Gnat_ off a hundred meters or so. We are going to bring the _Prospect_ down to just sail-out, and creep at two knots. We will hold it steady. Then it is all you: dive the _Gnat_, come up underneath, you should see the mating collar just about under where the sail would be on the bottom -- about one-third of the way forward from the stern. Bring the _Gnat_ up under, and _gently_ pop your mating collar into ours, and if you boys did not miss on the location of the docking clamps by too much, you should be able to lock into the hull of the _Prospect_... like a male angler fish."

Shakes raised his middle finger and held it boldly facing in Hemi's direction.

"...When you are clamped on, bang on your hatch with one of those wrenches of yours. I will have Gregory down there waiting to hear from you. Do _not_ open the hatch til Gregory bangs back, OK? Even in its current condition, the _Prospect_ will do a lot better if your welds leak than the _Gnat_ will. Keep in touch over the ship-to-ship."

Shakes pounded his acknowledgment on the side of the sail, and his head disappeared from the bridge. It was still so quiet aboard the _Prospect_ with no engines and so few systems running that they could hear the _Gnat's_ Diesels fire up, and inarticulate shouts from Shakes to Gregory on the deck as Shakes cast off the lines and Gregory retrieved them and pulled up the bumpers.

"Hey-fucking-ho!" Shakes voice came crackling over the ship-to-ship. "I'm fired up, buttoned up, and off fuckin' motoring. Out."

Hemi pulled down the ship-to-ship mic. "Got it Shakes. Remember, _gentle_ is the word."

"I'm allllways fuckin' genteel."

"We are going to take the _Prospect_ down to sail-out depth now. Hold tight until I give you the go."

[//]: # (### they dive to sail-out depth)

Hemi got on the ship PA and flipped the switch for both internal and external speakers. "Gregory, lock down all the external hatches as you come back inside. Owen and Bastian, come up to the control room, we are going to dive the boat to sail-out depth."

Moments later the entire crew converged on the control room. Gregory was climbing down from the sail, sealing the hatch above his head. Bastian and Owen were climbing up the ladder into the control room, and Chips arrived in the navigation and sonar compartment just under the control room with Captain Percy.

Captain Percy looked at Chips with the question she wanted to ask obvious and unnecessary, but she asked it anyway: "why the fuck are you here?"

"If we fuckin' go down, I want to be right next to you when you know death is on you Captain Percy. I want to be able to look you in the eye when tell you: I fuckin' told ya so," said Chips.

"On every trip to hell Chips, a crowd of people stand on shore waving. And they shout their goodbyes, but they don't say 'bon voyage', they say 'I told you so," replied Percy. "If you're gonna be up here, sit at the radar and let us know if we're going to have a surprise audience for this operation." 

Captain Percy waited for Gregory to clear the ladder from the control room on his way to the lowest deck of the boat with his instructions from Hemi before she climbed up into the control room which was once again at capacity with its full compliment of four people.

"OK, Bastian. Give us a two knot creep. We want just enough to keep us steady against the motion of the water," said Hemi. 

Bastian nudged the throttle forward, and they heard the hum of the electric motors rise from the depths of the boat as they the propeller came under torque. 

Percy pulled at the ship-to-ship mic. "Shakes, we are going to try submerging the hull now. If you see the sail disappear, this boat is never coming back up."

"Right." Shakes voice crackled. "I won't wait around for another fuckin' meal then."

Percy hung the mic back on its nubbin. "OK, you know what the old submariners say: always do the stupidest things on the smallest amount of sleep." She nodded to Hemi. 

"Owen, open the main ballast valves," Hemi gave the instruction that would begin the maneuver. 

Owen swiveled his chair to face the tank control panel, and gave a quarter turn to both of the small wheels that opened the valves at the same time. They could hear the hiss of air escaping up through the main ballast valves ahead of the sail as sea water pushed up into the ballast tanks from below and displaced the air into the atmosphere above.

"Just a thin hair of down angle on the dive planes, if you please," said Hemi.

Owen was ready for this, he had been resting one hand on the large wheel that controlled the dive planes. He rolled it a short distance around its circumference.

"As soon as you feel the angle on the boat Owen, level it back out again." By the time Hemi had said this, there was already a slight angle down on the bow. 

From the radar station below they could hear Chips muttering. "No fuckin' redundant system, fucking nothing at all..."

Owen already had the dive planes leveled out again and the slight angle came off the _Prospect's_ deck. Owen and Hemi were watching the depth gauge closely as it slowly lifted up off its pin. When it indicated a couple of meters of depth, Hemi reached over and closed the main ballast tank valve wheels himself. They all listened for the sound of the hissing, escaping air to stop. No one was breathing as the sound went on longer than it seemed like it should. But it wavered, slowed and ceased as the valves came to their closed position.

"Give it another minute... make sure everything is where it should be..." said Hemi. 

The boat held at its shallow depth, the deck fully submerged and most of the sail still above the surface. Captain Percy reached up to pat Hemi's huge shoulder. In some ways it seemed like such a small thing -- a basic maneuver they had done a thousand times before, but Hemi, at least, knew Chips was right: what was usually so routine was, in this case, incredibly risky. He felt a tremendous release of tension that He had not quite known had come on him when the main ballast valves opened. But everything had worked the way it was supposed to to.

"Good," said Percy, satisfied. "We didn't sink her by flooding the fucking main ballast. Now let's see if we can do it by opening a hole in the bottom plugged with nothing but a rusty bucket of a home-made boat."

[//]: # (### Mating the gnat to the prospect)

Hemi got on the ship-to-ship. "Captain Shakes, we are holding at sail-out depth, two-knot forward creep. I think you can begin your dive now."

"Fuckin' righto," came Shakes crackling reply.

Captain Percy raised the periscope and swiveled around until she could see the tiny, nearly-invisible gray sail of the _Gnat_ bobbing in the gray water off their port side. It picked up speed, and a little wake formed behind it. Then it shrank down and disappeared under the surface like a sun winking out at the horizon. She lowered the periscope back down.

"I'm gonna get on sonar," she said. 

Hemi nodded.

Percy slipped down the ladder and tapped Chips on the shoulder. "Chips, I think it would be good if you joined Gregory in the bottom of the boat. And bring a welding rig down there with you... just in case."

"If you're fuckin' staying in this room, I'm happy to go somewhere else." Chips left the sonar compartment moving forward toward the cargo hold to find her welding rig.

Captain Percy sat in the seat Chips vacated and glanced at the empty radar scope to make sure it remained empty. She put the sonar headphones on, and turned the directional control until she could hear the soft buzz of the _Gnat's_ electric motor. Shakes was lining up directly behind the _Prospect_, slightly deeper and with more speed. She could follow his progress with a fair amount of precision through the sonar and its range finder. But he disappeared for a minute when he moved into their wake where the sonar could not hear anything. In another minute she expected to hear the _Gnat_ directly underneath the _Prospect_.

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
‚Åü

On board the _Gnat_ shakes leaned his head down at a painful angle, looking up through the small viewport and trying to see exactly where he was in relation to the hulking gray wall slowly stirring the waters above him.

"Fuuuuuck. They shoulda mentioned that this would be stupidly fuckin' dangerous," Shakes said to himself. "I fuckin' walked right into this, I guess. Or maybe they are like a backyard bully in a pool, tormenting me -- the scrawny kid -- by holding my head underwater... Though I suppose some people must be into that sort of thing." He glanced at the stacks of porno at his feet.

"Captain Shakes," Hemi's voice came over the ship-to-ship with all the bass notes stripped out of it, "do not forget that since we are moving, you are going to have to give your boat a little more motor when you get within a meter of the _Prospect_ or so. We are going slow enough that it should not be too dramatic, but you also do not want to get sucked back into the _Prospect's_ propellers."

"Aye, fuck you all," he didn't bother to respond on the radio, his hands too busy with the controls of the _Gnat_. "This little fuckin' boat wasn't built for this shit. Handles like a fucking beach ball underwater."

He was pushing up from behind, moving slightly faster than the _Prospect_. Through the viewport, he could just see the little black circle of the mating collar he was shooting for. He realized now that he would lose sight of it when he got closer and the target slipped beyond his ability to crane his neck. 

He squeezed the ballast blow handle in a very short burst, and the _Gnat_ popped up an entire meter closer to the underside of the _Prospect_. "Ugh, too fuckin' much, too fast. _Gently_ -- was what Hemi said -- gently..." 

He was slowly gaining on the _Prospect_. When the _Prospect's_ mating collar disappeared beyond the frame of the viewport, Shakes guessed he was directly underneath it. He gave the _Gnat's_ small dive planes a modest amount of up-angle. Suddenly he was within a meter of the _Prospect's_ belly, and he could feel the push of water from the moving hull of the big boat driving the _Gnat_ backwards. The push was also ruining his instinctive awareness of where he was. He felt a slight panic, until the mating collar popped into view again through the narrow viewport directly ahead of him. 

He gave the _Gnat_ a little more power to the electric motor, and it moved forward through the streaming water. He held very close to the _Prospect_. The _Gnat_ slowly gained ground until the mating collar disappeared over his head again. He angled the dive planes up a bit, and with a loud clang the mating collars of the two ships collided.

Shakes squeezed the ballast blow handle again -- with as short a burst as he could possibly get. This gave the _Gnat_ enough buoyancy to hold it firmly up against the bottom of the _Prospect_.

He visualized what was happening in his head: the two mating collars were pressed against each other, held together but not aligned. If Shakes could correctly guess which direction to move the _Gnat_, the mating collar would pop into place. If he guessed wrong, the _Gnat_ would slip off the _Prospect's_ mating collar and crunch up against the bottom of the bigger boat. If that happened -- and he was lucky enough that his welds did not rip apart and sink him -- he would have to begin the whole maneuver over again.

He slowly eased the controls, a little rudder port, a little rudder starboard, a little forward power, a little off the throttle. He was moving the mating collar around in a circle, trying to get it to slip into the _Prospect's_ collar. There was the sound of steel ring grinding on steel ring, until with another clang, the small sub popped upwards. All he could see out of his viewport now was the long undistinguished gray hull of the _Prospect_ stretched out in front of him. Either he was in the mating collar, or had slipped off the front of it. 

But it felt right. Shakes gave a tiny further squeeze on the main ballast blow so that the _Gnat_ would have good strong upward buoyancy against the bottom of the _Prospect_. The way to know for sure if the two rings were mated was the docking clamps. He flipped the exposed switch he and Owen had installed. With a small blue spark it connected the circuit that ran up the thick wires, through the holes they had drilled and sealed into the sail, to the mating clamps. He heard a third clang, and a green bulb next to the switch lit. If he had missed the mating collar, the clamps would not have closed, so he was on. To be sure, he disengaged the electric motor to let the prop spin freely. When he did so, he could feel the bow of the _Gnat_ bend downward a small amount in a way that slightly sickened him, but the speed indicator did not change. The _Gnat_ was being dragged by the _Prospect_. 

He picked up the ship-to-ship. "Hemi, I think I'm fuckin' on."

"Yes. We can feel the drag up here. We are going to trim our tanks to adjust for the weight of the _Gnat_ hanging on, and then shut down our engines to save our batteries. I think you can give a bang on your hatch now, and see if Chips can open up the junction between us."

[//]: # (----- invisible character break)
‚Åü

[//]: # (### The hatch needs to be repaired)

In the deepest part of the _Prospect_, in the narrow hall between the forward and rear battery rooms with heavy water-tight bulkhead doors on either side, Gregory and Chips sat on the deck on either side of a well where they had pulled up the grating between them. Their feet dangled down into the well and Gregory tapped his toes lightly on the still-closed hatch while they waited for the signal from Shakes.

"Ehhh, Chips, should we close and seal this watertight bulkhead door behind me here? Seems like if Shakes' welds fail completely when we open this hatch -- and worse case, say, the _Gnat_ tears away or something -- we'll be flooding the whole _Prospect_ from this hole we're opening in the bottom of the boat, eh?" Gregory's voice was twinged with nerves.

"I got my fucking bulkhead hatch closed and sealed on this side. If it starts flooding fast, we are going out your door and closing it the fuck behind us. There's no fuckin' way we're sealing our fuckin' selves in here and risking being fuckin' heroes to save this ship."

"Alright, I'm following you then Chips."

"Keep that fucking portable bilge pump ready though: if there's a small leak then some modest fuckin' heroics will be required of us."

At this point they could hear the _Gnat_ grinding against the mating collar of the _Prospect_, screeching metal-on-metal as it moved back and forth trying to find the docked position. And then there was the loud crunch of the two boats coming together.

"Sound's like he's fuckin' on," said Chips, "we wait till we get the OK from Hemi though."

Gregory nodded.

They could feel the shuddering vibrations of the _Gnat's_ motor through the hull of the _Prospect_ for a few minutes, and then that died away when Shakes shut it down. A few moments later the _Prospect's_ motors shut down too. They heard Shakes bang out a ringing shave-and-a-haircut with one of his wrenches on the top hatch of the _Gnat_, below the still-closed bottom hatch of the _Prospect_. Then it was quite silent until Hemi came crackling over the ship PA. "OK Chips, open it up."

Chips nodded to Gregory and he reached down into the hatch well and cranked open the sealing wheel. He pulled up the hatch and water steadily flooded up around their feet. Gregory jumped up, as if bitten. But Chips lay out flat on the grating and reached her hand down into the pool of water. She felt along the welds until she could feel where the water was pushing in.

"The welds are _mostly_ -- but not totally -- fucking failing. You can see it's leaking," said Chips. "Get the pump hooked up Gregory, and let's get as much of this fucking water out of here as fast as fucking possible. Then I'll see if I can weld it decent like."

While Gregory got the hoses for the bilge pump connected, Chips got on the PA with Hemi. "We gotta fucking fix these shitty fuckin' welds or it'll flood the _Gnat_ when we open its hatch, Hemi. Tell Shakes to sit tight, and not to do a fuckin' thing." Hemi acknowledged, and she started putting her welding gear on.

[//]: # (----- EDITED TO HERE -----)

It was cold, frustrating, cramped work. But such had been all of Chips work on this trip -- maybe her whole life, she reflected. She let out a never-slowing stream of curses, attempting to damn down to a permanent watery hell not just all materials and work processes, but all the societal systems and turns of fate that had conspired against her to bring her to this particular misery. 

Shakes' welds were horrifically ugly, like stitch work on a revivified 19th Century cadaver. Stopping the leaks required hammering metal sheet patches into place, and welding them until they no longer leaked. Chips felt nothing but lucky when the leaking started to slow without her having made the situation worse by cutting through the mating ring or the hull of the _Gnat_.

Eventually Chips had welded enough patching material in place that the leak slowed to a seep, and then finally stopped altogether. The pump sucked the last of the water out the well, leaving them looking at the domed top hatch of the _Gnat_ down in the recess. The whole mess was holding, though Chips hoped she would never have to test it at any depth deeper than they already were.

Chips banged on the hatch with the end of the welding stick. "Eh Shakes ya fucker. You can open this fuckin' thing up now." She yelled into the empty metal well, her voice bouncing the curses back at her. There was the sound of the rusty sealing gears squeaking open and the hatch lifted up. 

Shakes was grinning up at them as residual water rained down on him. "Who's a fuckin' angle-fish now, eh motherfuckers?"

"Don't touch them fucking welds when ya come through, the fuckers are still hellish fuckin' hot."

Shakes put his arms up through the hatch hole, found a place to grab that wasn't warm from welding, lifted his foot to some protruding bit of steel in the sail of the _Gnat_, and stepped up into the _Prospect_. Gregory pushed the ship intercom button and told Hemi they had Shakes aboard. 

"Right. _Now_ the hard part." Said Hemi over the intercom. Then got on the ship PA, and asked everyone to meet him down at the hatch to the _Gnat_.


[//]: # (### Rigging up power to the Prospect)

"So basically we are going to suck the life out of the _Gnat_ to keep the _Prospect_ going." Hemi told them when they were all assembled and standing crammed in on both sides of the open hatch to the _Gnat_ below. 

Shakes squirmed. 

Hemi continued. "I am going to set up some heavy jumpers between the _Gnat's_ battery banks and the battery rooms of the _Prospect_, where we are standing right now. That should be pretty straightforward, and give us access to the _Gnat's_ remaining battery power. Though not much, in terms of the _Prospect's_ power consumption.

"Chips, I need you to do the harder part and figure out how to get the fuel that is left in the _Gnat_ up into the _Prospect's_ engines. I'm not sure if it would be better to try to pump it into the _Prospect's_ fuels tanks, or run it straight from the _Gnat's_ fuel tanks to the _Prospect's_ diesels."

"Be fuckin' easier to just run a long hose up to the fuckin' _Prospect's_ fuckin' fuel pumps. Won't have to fuck around with the trim as much." Put in Chips.

"If you think that will work, it sounds OK to me." Said Hemi. "Sylvia, you want to weigh in with anything?"

"This fucking project is all you, Hem'." Said Captain Percy.

"From this moment," Hemi went on, "we need to shut down absolutely everything we are not using. We really should have done this already. We will need every bit of power we can suck out of the _Gnat_ to get across the Authority line into vaguely friendlier waters. I am even shutting down all the lighting, so you will all need to carry a light around with you. The good news is, if we get the diesels going, you can all take some rotations in the rack, since there will be no power to do anything else but sleep anyway.

"Chips, you take Owen and Gregory to work on fuel lines. Bastian, we will go dig up those jumpers. Try to stay out of each other's way everyone." Hemi Finished up. 

Grabbing Bastian's skinny arm, Hemi led him away to stowage where he hoped to find the long heavy jumper cables he remembered seeing there sometime in the past year.

Chips took Owen and Gregory off to the engine rooms to get the long fuel hoses they normally used for refueling down off their racks on the wall and rigged up through the boat down to the _Gnat_.

Captain Percy looked down at the mess of patches and foul blackened welds that lined the passageway down through the hole in the bottom of her boat, and for a moment could not believe they were still afloat. "Shakes," she said to the only person left with her, "let me buy you a cup of coffee."


[//]: # (### Rigged up and running)

In a matter of a couple of hours they had a series of umbilicals running through the _Prospect_ and down into the _Gnat_. The big submarine was parasitically sucking the small supply of nutrients the little sub had in reserve: the power wired into the _Prospect's_ battery hold so that the _Gnat's_ batteries were now no more than an extra battery bank for the _Prospect_ -- conveniently with a nearly-full charge; and the thick fuel lines running up to the engine room, where the fuel pumps were engaged and tuned to gently suck the fuel up from the _Gnat's_ fuel ballast tanks.

To conserve fuel they started only one of the _Prospect's_ multiply redundant diesel engines. And likewise started only one of the electric motors, driving only one of the _Prospect's_ two propellers. This continually pushed them to one side and they had to compensate with some angle on the rudder, but that was a minor annoyance. Normally they would also be charging the battery banks up while running on diesel, but they needed to put the all the fuel they had into forward motion. 

It was a filthy inelegant mess, but they were making headway.

Captain Percy insisted everyone who was not doing something actively should be in the rack. Chips, Shakes, and Hemi didn't argue when they were assigned first shift in bed. She had Bastian and Gregory, who were more experienced with the controls of the boat, at the helm seats. They shut down the sonar figuring with the diesel running they would not be able to hear the approach of any kind of threat until it was too close to do anything about it anyway. Particularly considering they could not dive or perform any other evasive maneuver.

But as a safety measure, Percy put Owen on radar. It would be just stupid to run into a fleet of Authority surface enforcement ships. So Owen sat in the dark with his eye on the glowing radar screen, his mind turned to mush by watching it circle around endlessly, reflecting back nothing.

Percy made everyone in the control room drink two cups of coffee, which she fixed for them in the dark galley by the light of a penlight.

After a few hours of running like this -- the ship humming and vibrating under them, the superstructure groaning with the stress of dragging along the _Gnat_, and the continual course correction necessitated by running on a single propeller -- Percy decided she needed to see how far they had managed to travel. At the navigation table, she measured with the calipers and laid down a string of hashes from the X that marked the spot where they had mated the _Gnat_. 

They were making terrifyingly slow process. With the calipers, Percy spun out the remaining distance to the line Shakes had drawn marking where they would move into the territory of a different -- hopefully safer --  Authority. She estimated they still had something like eight hours to go. And that was assuming Shakes' line was at all accurate. In addition to just being a rough mark Shakes had laid down from memory, for all she knew the Authorities might have battled or treatied the line into a totally different part of the ocean. They would not be truly safe until they were docked at the depot. And even then, who knew what the depot folks would be like. Somewhat friendlier to commerce was about all one could hope for with any confidence.

After six hours listening to the uninterrupted engine-drone in the darkness, Percy made another pot of coffee, and brought it down to the crew quarters along with a few tin cups tied together with a small bit of wire. She used her flashlight to hunt her relief crew out of their respective racks, and forced coffee into them. Chips strung curses at her, but as red as Chips' eyes were they weren't even close to the bloodshot droop that Percy was dragging around in her own eyeballs by now.

"Chips, go up and relieve Owen at radar. Hemi you're with me at the controls." Shakes had pulled the blackout curtain aside and was peering blearily down at them and their coffee from a top rack. "Shakes, you can go back to sleep."

"_Captain_ Shakes. And no fucking way. My boat's on the fucking line here too. I can help y'all drive this fucking conglomeration of scrap."

"I won't fucking insist otherwise. Have a cup of coffee, we'll put you on the throttle/rudder."


[//]: # (### Radar contact with the pursuing sub)

With Hemi and Shakes at the controls, and Gregory, Owen, and Bastian stumbling off wearily following the arcs of their flashlights to their racks, Percy lit up a cigarillo and sat down next to Chips at the radar station. Neither of them said anything, they were both too tired for conversation or fighting. It looked like it was taking all of Chips' remaining aggressive energy to keep her eyes following the sweeping line of the radar around the scope.

Captain Percy jumped to her feet. Sitting was not going to work. She realized she was falling asleep despite the discomforts of the chair designed to keep a person upright and alert. She flicked her flashlight on and leaned over the navigation table. She again measured the distance to Shakes' imaginary line in the ocean. Their progress was merely hobbling along.

Chips broke the numbing silence. "Fuckin' got somethin'."

Percy stepped back to the radar/sonar station and lowered her head over the scope. A small and distant blip was appearing and fading away with each pass of the _Prospect's_ radar. "Fuck. Well, it was probably too fucking much to hope the ocean would remain empty for us. OK, shut down the radar, switch to sonar. They are pretty far fuckin' off. Hopefully they will just drive on by."

[//]: # (Blipblipbeep sadly faded off my radar. I regret it to this day! I think of you every time I eat a piece of quiche. Maybe I should have the characters in this story eat quiche? Seems like good submarine food.)

[//]: # (Does explanation of radar in next graf repeat earlier explanation?)

She watched to make sure Chips shut down the radar completely. It was possible for a surface ship to see their radar when it was running and not only discover they were there, but calculate their exact location. On the other hand passive sonar was just microphones in the water -- it did not send any signal out by which they could be tracked. Of course their noisy diesel engines were sending out plenty of sound at the moment, if anyone got close enough to listen for it.

"Won't be able to hear fuckin' much on sonar with the fuckin' diesel running." Complained Chips.

"That's why you're going to have to really fucking focus, try to pick out any change in mechanical sound above the diesel. If you think you hear something, we'll shut it down and have a quiet listen. Otherwise we'll stop every half hour or so and see if we hear that contact on the sonar -- or anyone else -- coming towards us. Can you handle that Chips without fucking blowing up?"

Chips groaned. "Ya fuckin' smart fuckin' pisswad."

Percy pointed her flashlight towards the galley. "Have another fucking cup of coffee Chips."

Captain Percy called to Hemi through the hatch up to the control room. When his face appeared squinting into the beam of her light, she told him they had a distant contact so they shut down the radar and switched to sonar. Because of that contact, he should be ready to shut down the diesel on short notice. He nodded and turned back to the dive plane and tank controls.

While Chips was in the galley setting up some coffee, Percy sat down at the sonar station and put the headset over her ears. The headset was full of the heavy droning hum of the diesel engine, moderated by some swish of water running along the hull and the grinding wash where the water split against the sail of the _Prospect_ moving through the surface.

Captain Percy flipped some switches to engage filters, and the texture of the sound in her ears changed. She blocked out some of the lower frequencies of the engine, and tried to imagine if she could hear the higher pitch of a ship screw spinning in the water. But the sound was relentlessly undifferentiated and unchanging.

Chips came back holding one of the tin coffee cups. She put on the second sonar headset and remained standing a few steps from where Percy was sitting.

After half an hour of this silent watch, Percy called up to Hemi to shut down the diesel so they could have a better listen, and a minute later a blessed silence came into the headset. A feeling of genuine relief flowed through her as the silence filled her ears. Sometimes she wondered if the eternal hum of machines that accompanied life aboard a submarine subtly and slowly chewed away at her soul. On top of the silence, there was no apparent sound of any other ships within sonar range. Percy flipped through a few filters, and the quality of the silence changed, from a deadening whoosh to a soft hiss. 

And then she heard a pulse. A distant, faint heartbeat in the ocean, accompanied by the sloshing flow of circulation. She touched Chips arm, pointed to the softly fluttering signal-strength gauge.

"Aye." Confirmed Chips. "That's the right direction for our fuckin' radar contact to approach us. They just fuckin' moved into fucking sonar range."

"Fuck. We're gonna have to do something. Stay on it Chips."

"Fuckin' aye."

Percy scaled the ladder up to the control room, and raised the periscope, twisting it around as it rose to aim it at the heading of the contact -- somewhere on their rear starboard quarter. She did not expect to see anything, and there was nothing to see -- the distance was still too far. But a visual check was the practical and right thing to do first. She lowered the periscope.


[//]: # (### They submerge to periscope depth)

"Hemi..." Percy hesitated, "I think we gotta submerge to periscope depth -- get the sail underwater -- and shut down the diesels. Run on the _Gnat's_ remaining batteries. How long can we fucking last like that?"

"Well, putting aside the risk of again opening the main ballast valves to lower us even further into the water, the _Gnat_ has maybe an hour of battery we could use at this super-slow creep rate we are moving at. And I should also point out that once the _Gnat's_ batteries are fully depleted, we will have no more options for underwater maneuvering if we do not lose this contact. Or if we come across another."

"I know. I'm going on instinct here, and fuck me if I'm wrong. Especially considering I haven't slept in days and my head is fucking killing me from eight cups of coffee a day. But I got a sense we don't want to see that fucker coming towards us up there."

"Or: we do not want them to see us, you mean."

"Fucking Right."

Hemi nodded. "Alright. I'll open the main ballast valves." He reached up and pushed the dive alarm.

"Ah fuck ya all," Chips yelled up to them, pulling one earpiece of the headset off her ear when she heard the dive alarm, "yer fucking taking us down to periscope depth, ain't ya? We can't run the diesels at periscope, there's no way to feed 'em oxygen. So how the fuck are ya planning to get back on the surface if the batteries fucking die, eh? We'll have no way to steer the boat up to the surface, and we got no fuckin' way to pump the water out! We'll just be fucking sitting there with one fucking eyeball view above the surface, effectively fucking drowned."

"Thank you for keeping us apprised of the risks Chips." Percy yelled back. "I'm still fucking in charge though. Hemi, take us down to periscope."

Hemi flipped open the main ballast valve switches and there was again a rush of air as more of it was released from the top of the ballast tanks, and water eased in from the vents open to the sea on the bottom. Hemi watched the glowing depth gauge until the needle got into the range marked 'periscope,' and then flipped the ballast valve switches closed again. There was a clink that echoed through the hull and the rush of air and water stopped.

"See Chips, the fucking valves are still working as they are supposed to, which we knew because of your inspection earlier. We aren't fucking sunk yet." Captain Percy gave the aside with enough volume that Chips would be able to hear her in the compartment below.

"Depends on what ya fuckin' mean by 'sunk'." Said Chips quietly to the sonar station.

"We can't afford to take an evasive route to the depot Hemi, we gotta go straight at 'em. So we'll just have to hope our contact up there wasn't able to track us long enough to figure out our course. Put us back on the electric motors -- so they won't be able to hear us unless they get right on top of us." Said Percy. "Um... also keep what Chips said in mind -- make sure we have a little something left in the batteries to get us back to the surface."

"These battery gauges are hardly very precise Percy. I would not push it beyond ten minutes remaining on the battery." Said Hemi.

"Make sure I know when we're about 20 minutes from empty batteries." Said Percy. She raised the periscope and aimed it again in the direction of the contact they had heard on sonar.


[//]: # (### Tracking the contact moving towards them)

Sometimes new crew members thought it must be something of a mental relief to be able to look through the periscope after days or weeks inside a submarine -- the opportunity to have even a brief glimpse of the surface world, and to look off at range instead of objects that are never much more than a meter from your face. Captain Percy remembered believing this herself when she first started working on submarines as a teenager. And honestly, she would give her crew shifts on the periscope if she believed it would actually help keep them mentally steady. But the control room was already cramped, and more than that, she knew from the years of experience she now had sighting through periscopes that it did not do much for the clarity of one's mind. Sometimes it even made the claustrophobia of the sub worse. At periscope depth, the viewport end of the device could never be more than a meter or two above the surface. There was rarely anything to see except a world entirely made up of an undifferentiated horizon of lighter gray against dark gray. It was almost always like that, except during the brief periods when they were within sight of land, and this moment was no exception.

On the surface, it was night. A waning moon above the cloud layer gave enough light to see the ocean swells. The swells were moderately significant, which was good -- the _Prospect_ would be harder to hear on sonar and almost impossible to spot visually. Through the scope Percy watched the black swells rise and fall around her, pushing up and easing down the lighter gray field of the sky with a steady cadence. It was a little dizzying and almost nauseating. Every so often the swell would pass over the top of the periscope and she would have a few seconds of blackness as a relief.

"Chips!" Percy gave her voice a little more emphasis because she didn't remove her face from the periscope frame. "Make sure you stay on that fucking sonar contact. Track the direction and range. Let me know if they get within something like visual range."

"Aye, I'm-a fuckin' trackin' their fucking course already. Fuckin surprise! They're fucking coming towards us. Still out ten fuckin' miles or so."

"Fuck." Whispered Percy into the greasy steel column of the periscope in front of her face. She swung the scope slowly back and forth across the bearing of the contact.

Minutes passed in silence, except for the faint hum of the electric motor pushing them forward slowly through the water, and Chips occasionally calling out ranges. The contact was quickly marching towards them.

"Fuckers are moving fast and loud." Called up Chips. "Like they ain't afraid of no fuckin' shit."

"That is how armed ships behave." Said Hemi from the control seat. "Probably caught a whiff of us at a distance, and they are charging fast into a range where they can quiet down and take a listen; try to acquire the sound of our electric motor on sonar."

Deep within Captain Percy she pushed down a primitive instinct urging her to run. A fresh young sub driver might crank as hard as she could on the throttle to get away from a threat. But evolution had moved submarines toward a different escape tactic: slink away silently. They were in a very, very slow-speed race: get out of range of the pursuer's sonar, as slowly and quietly as possible.

After a few more minutes of staring at an empty black sea, seeing nothing and at the same time knowing they were out there, Percy could no longer stand just relying on Chips' range estimates. She lowered the periscope and slipped down the ladder and stepped over to the navigation table. Chips immediately understood what she was doing, and without saying anything handed Percy a piece of scrap paper on which she had written a list of ranges and bearings for the contact in pencil. 

Captain Percy leaned over the navigation table, holding her flashlight pointed at their location on the chart with one hand.  At the same time she read the markings on Chips' paper and used her other hand to lay down the contact's course and times on the chart with a grease pencil. She then marked out their own progress since they picked up the contact on sonar, but it was so short it almost didn't merit marking on the chart.

"Fuck they're moving fast." Said Percy to herself. "We might be able to fucking see them already."

"Fuckin' possible, ya." Agreed Chips.


[//]: # (### Percy sees the sub with the ram through the periscope again)

Percy scaled the ladder up to the control room quickly, and raised the periscope, spinning it to look out over their rear quarter as it rose. She scanned for just a moment, and then she saw a long, low dark shadow running across the black surface of the water. It kicked up whitecaps where it plowed through the swells, and left a string of white wake behind it. A large black fin rose from the body of the black shadow and from that fin a soft red glow followed by a long black stream of soot marking its passage through the air in parallel to the wake it left marking its passage through the water -- a sub running on diesel. Even as Percy watched, the red glow faded, and the white wake died away. They were shutting down their diesels so they could hear better.

The pursuing submarine was two or three miles off, and running crosswise across the path the _Prospect_ had traveled along. So from where Percy was she could see the whole length of the boat. And mounted to its bow was the same medieval ramming contraption she had seen before. The same that had ripped a wound in her boat.

"It's that same sub that rammed us! Power down the motor Hemi. We're going silent, and hopefully they'll miss us."

Hemi flipped some switches and the hum of the electric motors died away. Captain Percy watched the sub with the ram through the periscope. They had engaged their own electric motors and were moving forward again. The bow suddenly sank under the black swells of the ocean, and the rest of the deck followed a few moments later. Streams of misted water were shooting up from its deck as Percy watched the sail sinking into the black line where the surface met the sky.

"They're diving." Percy told Hemi. "Chips! They went down. With our motors off, you should still be able to follow them on sonar. Track 'em, and let me know what the fuck they're doing."

"Aye fuck." Chips called back up from sonar.

Percy let the periscope sink down to its recess.

"Should we get moving?" Hemi asked.

"No. Let's see if we can figure out what they're doing first. We'll hide silently and cower for the moment." Percy lit a cigarillo and pulled at it between her lips. "We'll wait."

They waited. It took maybe twenty minutes for Chips to give a report. She called Percy down to the navigation table.

"Fuckin' look here," said Chips "I tracked the fuckers down from where we first fuckin' heard 'em. They shot right to the last location we were running the fuckin' diesel... a few fucking miles behind us now. But, after they submerged, they didn't fuckin' turn to follow us, they turned the other fucking way, and then kept turning." Chips marked out their path in a circle away from them on the chart.

"Search pattern eh?" Said Percy.

"Fuck ya, if I ever seen one. They're lookin' for us, but don't know where to fuckin' look, is my fucking thinking."

"Good. This is our chance. We gotta get out of range before they complete their search circle and start a new circle in our direction." Percy called up to Hemi. "Get us moving again Hem'. Back to a creep, same heading -- toward the depot."


[//]: # (### They try to run from the sub with the ram)

The hum of the electric motors came back up, and the _Prospect_ steadily moved on. Percy sat with Chips at the sonar station and listened to the sound of the pursuing sub's screws off in the distance.  The signal grew very weak as the submarine got off to the far end of their search circle, but grew stronger as they returned towards their starting point. Percy continually marked their track on the navigation chart according their range finding calculations.

"We're not out of this yet." Percy said to Chips. "They're moving fast. Makes it easy to fucking track 'em, but their next search circle will almost certainly be the other side of a figure-eight, directly the opposite direction of their first -- and directly towards us." Chips nodded. "We gotta be out of range of their search circle before they go past."

"They could fuckin' ping us with active sonar and fuckin' find us that way." Pointed out Chips.

"And they might yet. But they might be not want to risk us being an armed enemy ship. They're trying to get a soft sense of their target first, if they can."

"We're fuckin' screwed if they fucking ping us then."

"Hopefully they won't. Give me a new batch of ranges to them." Chips read out the ranges, and Percy marked them down. The sub with the ram had completed their circle, passed through the point they had started at, and had turned in the opposite direction now. "They're coming towards us." Said Percy.


[//]: # (### Percy decides to hold still and wait them out)

Captain Percy did some quick math. She knew the pursuing submarine's speed, and with a few more ranges from Chips, she knew the arc of their second search circle. The _Prospect_ was cutting almost directly across that circle, but so slowly compared to the speed of the other sub that there was no way the _Prospect_ was going to pass out of the pursuing sub's search circle in time. At their current rate, both subs might arrive at the far point of the circle at the same time. Percy stood back from the navigation table, holding her flashlight on the chart with one hand and sucking at her cigarillo with the other. The coal of tobacco glowed in the dark with each puff. She leaned over and put a small x at the _Prospect's_ current location -- almost exactly in the middle of what would eventually be the other sub's completed search circle.

"Hemi," she called up to the control room, "shut her down again. Let's make a hole in the water."

The electric motors faded off leaving the _Prospect_ completely silent. Hemi came down from the control room and ran his light over the chart, and immediately understood. "We were not going to make it outside their search area in time, so instead we will hide in the middle of it?"

"Could be a stupid move." Percy replied. "Nothing preventing them from taking on a zigzag course all of a sudden."

"We're essentially counting on their sheer sense of symmetry."

"You put it that way and it gives me a wisp of hope. Symmetry can be a powerful thing sometimes."

Chips, for once, was not listening to their conversation and instead had both headset pieces over her ears, concentrating on the contact. Every minute or so she scratched down range and bearing data on the greasy-fingerprint stained pad in front of her, while her callused free hand slowly slipped the sonar directional wheel along to follow the contact. 

Percy tapped her on the shoulder, and Chips pulled back one of the earpieces. "I'm gonna have Hemi take over sonar tracking. We need our best ears for this. Go make sure everyone in the boat knows we need to stay absolutely silent. I don't want anyone deciding now is the time to take a huge shit and start flushing the head repeatedly trying to wash it down."

"Fuck and good riddance. I fucking hate fucking sonar anyway. Melts yer fucking mind into a fucking lump of inanimate fucking rock." She set the headset down and picked up her nearly-empty tin cup of cold coffee and her flashlight and headed forward toward the crew quarters.

Hemi sat down, and slid the sonar headset open as far as it would go before the earpieces went over the ears on his huge head. He handed the paper with Chips' bearings so far listed on it to Percy. She started plotting them down on the chart, the other submarine's search circle making its way steadily around in front of their location.

"Give me bearing and range every minute or so, Hem'." Percy stretched the second sonar headset wire over to the navigation table, and put an earpiece over one ear so she could hear what Hemi was hearing. She left the other ear open so she could hear Hemi's direction and range readings.

The boat now was totally silent in a way that only submarines could be. Surface ships were constantly swamped with sound -- water moving, the never-ceasing racket of the wind passing over the boat, and of course the loud rumble of the engines at an unvarying pitch that was rarely ever stopped at sea. A submarine was held suspended in a medium that ironically both transmitted sound better than air, but also isolated human ears evolved for sound that moved through air. It was silent enough that Percy could hear Hemi controlling his steady breathing to keep it from impinging on the sounds of his contact. 

With the boat shut down and nothing to do, Shakes sat on the deck of the control room with his legs dangling down through the hatch, smoking a cigarette. Percy could hear his long draws on the cigarette, and the paper crackling as it was burned away by the coal lighting Shakes' face in the dark.

Hemi had shut off all the sonar filters they normally had enabled to filter out any contact signal from the _Prospect's_ own noise. In the earpiece, Percy could hear an unusually rich cross-spectrum white noise that was the background sound of the deep ocean. Smack in the middle was the whirring and crackling of the contact's propellers stirring through the water. Hemi was extremely good at keeping the sonar mics tracking the source, so the sound rarely wavered in intensity. The signal was so clear she could almost see the propellers moving, her mind playing a strange game of converting sound input into a visual stimulation. 

With syncopated regularity, Hemi broke the silence to give her the range and direction. Every time he did, Percy added a small dash to the chart. The sub with the ram had moved directly in front of them, only a few nautical miles ahead. If the _Prospect_ had still be running her motor, the other sub would definitely have heard them. And if that sub out there was willing to risk an active ping at this range, they would discover the _Prospect's_ location instantly. Percy had her boat hiding in plain sight, in submarine terms. The only tactic the _Prospect_ had available at the moment was grinding, tense patience.

Percy matched her breathing to Hemi's. She focused on the sound of the searching submarine's propellers in her ear piece. She raised up her own calm, and pushed down all the fear she had. She slowly grew the dashed line on the chart as it lassoed them in, placing each dash with deliberate precision. Each time she put the point down the pencil created a long thin shadow across the chart in the light of her flashlight. The little x marking their location on the chart made it look like she had rendered the eyeball of a cartoon dead man. When the sub with the ram had passed in front of them, and was moving on the final part of the arc to complete their search circle, she decided it was time for them to sneak away.


[//]: # (### They get moving again)

She put her hand on Hemi's shoulder and he looked over at her. "Get us moving."

"Same heading -- towards the depot?" Hemi asked.

"It's our only option. Keep it slow and quiet though."

Hemi stood, pulling off the sonar headset. He tapped Shakes on the foot, and Shakes' dangling feet withdrew up into control room. Hemi climbed up and a few moments later, the hum of the _Prospect's_ electric motors returned, accompanied by an extremely mild sensation of acceleration.

Captain Percy stayed at the sonar station. She tracked the progress of the sub with the ram which had begun a third clover-leaf searching circle away from the _Prospect_. That sub was still moving relatively fast, and in 20 minutes they were far enough away that she was not able to continue tracking them over sonar. Their own track on the chart had pushed them out beyond the range of the other sub's circle pattern. It was always possible it would swing back around and intercept them, but Percy's breathing had returned to normal. Her guts told her they had sneaked out from under that one, though they still had to limp a bit of a distance further to get across Shakes' supposed Authority control line.


[//]: # (### They go back to sail-up and fire up the diesel)

It was not long before Hemi called down to her again. "Sylvia, we do not have much battery left. Roughly, maybe 20 minutes."

"Fuck." Said Percy, standing at the navigation table. By any sane margin 20 minutes of battery was already too little for safe underwater operation. She used the calipers to measure their remaining distance to the Authority Control line that Shakes had left on her chart. "We're still at least 10 minutes from getting under that Authority Control line."

"Eh," Shakes called down, "I wouldn't put too much stock in that line. Could be plus or minus by, like, eh, 50 fuckin' miles ya know."

Percy climbed up to the control room. "Wherever the actual line is, we can't fucking risk staying submerged anymore. Give us some upward dive plane Hemi, put our sail back over the surface. We'll have a good fucking listen and then start the diesels back up."

Hemi rotated the dive plane wheel and indicated to Shakes he should give them just a little bit more throttle. The bow of the _Prospect_ rose, and the depth gauge worked its way down toward its zero pin. Percy had Hemi go listen on the sonar rig, and when he reported no contacts, she shut down the electric motors, and pressed the starter for the diesel. With the extra power of the diesel running, she had them run the air compressors and pump air back into the main ballast tanks and trim tanks until the boat had enough buoyancy to stay at the surface even without the motors pushing them forward and the dive planes driving them upwards. With the sail back above water, she had Hemi go down to the crew quarters and wake Owen who she wanted up in the lookout ring above the sail.

"With some luck boys, we can be at the depot in a few more hours, and maybe still with a few whiffs of fuel left to pump from the _Gnat_. Shakes, we're gonna owe you fucking big for this." 

"Normally I'd say I'm just happy to help, but fuck that," said Shakes, "y'all sucked the life out of my little boat. A little financial help when we get t' the depot would be genuinely fucking appreciated."

"It's going to be something of a layout for us to get the _Prospect_ repaired, refueled, and fitted up for another cargo run. We'll do what we can for the _Gnat_, but don't expect a major reward or anything. It ain't like you rescued some fuckin' Authority oligarch yacht out there."

"Ya, fuck, I'll keep that in mind next time I'm fuckin' stupid enough to stop and to help folks in need."

When they crept under the place where the Authority Control line vaguely might be, Percy opened the hatch above the control room and climbed up to the bridge of the sail. Up in the light breeze she scanned around the horizon with a pair of binoculars. She saw some aircraft off in the distance, but they were not coming towards the _Prospect._ Soon, Percy felt like they must surely be in the new Authority's waters. But there was really no way to tell.

They cruised easily with the sail up and the diesel running for the next few hours. Hemi repeatedly made the trek down through the _Prospect_ and into the _Gnat_ to check the remaining fuel. He did not trust the _Gnat's_ fuel gauges. So each time he went down there he opened up the fuel tank and put in a dip stick and held it up to his flashlight by an oily rag to note the fuel level remaining. 

On one of these trips through the boat he found Chips asleep in her rack and woke her up. "Chips, I need you to tune those engines to within a inch of their life for efficient fuel consumption." He told her. She spent the rest of the trip to the depot deep in the ship, carefully and continually trimming the diesel engine's fuel intake.

No matter how parsimonious they were with the power usage and the fuel consumption though, the _Prospect_ was so much bigger that it was eating through the remaining fuel in the _Gnat_ at an insatiable rate. Back in the control room of the _Prospect_, Hemi calculated their fuel consumption rate by hand, and measured it against how far they had to go. He could not promise Percy that they would not be rowing the _Prospect_ the last few miles.


[//]: # (### They talk about why the sub with the ram is pursuing them)

By this time Hemi, Shakes, and Percy were exhaustedly staring at the wall of gauges in front of them. Most of the gauges were completely unmoving as they were not varying speed, direction, or depth, and the fuel gauge simply read zero, since it could not reflect the fuel they were sucking up from the _Gnat_. Other than Hemi's occasional forays down to the _Gnat_ to check the hard numbers, they were simply going on hope that they had enough fuel to make it to the depot and not get left stranded once again over an empty -- and very deep -- part of the ocean.

Hemi finally broke the bleary, smoke-filled silence. "Something bothers me Sylvia."

"We've been scraping our way on our bellies under the razor-wire fencing of hell's fucking perimeter for days now, and _now_ something bothers you Hem'?" Percy chuckled at him.

"I think that is part of it -- we have been so on edge and so burned out that I have not had a chance to step back and consider things."

"Well, what the fuck is it that's eatin' ya big guy?"

"The sub with the ram. You said the one hunting for us in circles back there was the same that rammed us, right? You are sure about that?"

"Abso-fucking-certain. Lotta subs look the same through the scope, sure, but that ram is unique. Some kinda custom job, without the sleek, expensive quality of gear ya see on military machines usually. Looks like it was worked up as some ancient siege engine, for storming a stone fortress or something. And some crazy motherfucker bought it as scrap and welded the whole fucking heavy water-dragging thing onto the front of their submarine."

Hemi nodded. "So if it is the same sub, which seems likely, it seems very _unlikely_ to me that they just happened on us twice. This is what is bothering me: do you think they are specifically pursuing _us_?"

"I had the same thought." Said Shakes. "But I didn't want to put my fucking nose into your business, just as I wouldn't want you askin' about mine. But since yer asking Hemi..."

"It does seem odd. We're just a fucking cargo sub." Percy said, looking steadily at Shakes. "Of course we're always being harassed by various Authorities in general-like ways -- that's just part of the business. But who among them has the inclination to _pursue_ a cargo sub? We're fuckin' small potatoes by any measure you care to put fuckin' to it. They have wars to fight and borders to defend up there. They spend their concentrated long-term resources on their never-ending fucking conflicts with each other. Harassing commerce too much is bad for, well, fucking business."

"And we are the commerce." Said Shakes.

"Even if that sub with the ram was pursuing us particularly," continued Percy, "seems most likely they won't fuckin' follow us across Authority lines, and they'll lay off the pursuit at this point. We'll just avoid coming back this way any time soon."

"Leaves ya with a big fuckin' mystery as to _why_ though, don't ya think?" Asked Shakes.

"Indeed." Said Hemi. "Though sometimes the pragmatic course of action is to leave the questions aside, and move in a different direction."

"And the direction we're moving in right now is towards that depot, and away from the fucking mystery of the sub with the ram." Said Percy.

The silence settled back in on them. Captain Percy lit up yet another cigarillo and puffed away at it steadily until she had filled up the small space of the control room with smoke. Hemi slid back down to the navigation chart with his flashlight, and a few minutes later called up to Percy. "Sylvia, you should be able to see the depot island from the bridge in a few minutes."

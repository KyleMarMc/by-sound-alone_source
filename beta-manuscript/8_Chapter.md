‚Åü

Around mid-afternoon Hemi joined Percy on the bridge of the sail. Bastian had been sent off for much-needed rest, and Gregory was temporarily covering sonar for Hemi, who needed a break to clear his mind after the endless streams of noise. Hemi would have asked Cassandra to cover for him, but there was no way to know how Percy would react if she found Cassandra back at the sonar station.

Percy was squinting into binoculars as she scanned around the horizon. She was unused to the brightness of the ocean under high daylight. 

She heard Hemi's heavy step up off the ladder onto the bridge, but she did not look away from the horizon while she spoke to him. "We have to make a move. The surface is an unnatural place for a submarine to hide. They are going to fucking find us eventually."

"Having charted their search pattern, I agree. They are following an extremely systematic course, and that suggests to me that sub commander has high confidence that he will find us eventually. And is willing to take the time to do it."

"We need to end this. We can't fucking run and hide forever. That fucker might be under the delusion he's fighting a fucking entrenched battle, and will go on fighting with all the deep-pocketed resources of an Authority. But we have got to get back to work. We have no fucking margin that covers operating in these conditions where were constantly some kind of fucked-up prey."

"I have had the same thought. And I have an idea we could try --- though I warn you it is extremely unlikely to work."

At this, Percy lowered the lenses and looked at him. "You have another option and you have been fuckin' holding out on me?"

"_Extremely_ unlikely to work --- and likely to get us killed." He took a breath. "The magnetic warheads... I let a couple of crates slip off the palettes when they were being unloaded in Stilt City. So I have a few dozen warheads still stashed down in our cargo hold."

"You want to try to hit them with one of those fuckin' explosives?"

"They are the only weapon we have."

"Indeed. But how do you deliver a fucking warhead to the sub? They are just _part_ of a weapon, as Miss Mai mentioned a number of times. We can't just underhand one over the water at them."

"That is the part of my idea that might get us killed --- I propose we use the _Gnat_."

"I don't think Shakes is going to appreciate you turning his boat into a fuckin' torpedo. As small and shittily made as it is."

Hemi proceeded to lay out a plan for her that, though likely to end with the destruction of the _Gnat_, did at least not intentionally involve blowing the _Gnat_ up. It did, however, use the _Prospect_ as bait. It took some convincing on Hemi's part for Percy to fully come around to supporting the idea.

"OK. We're going to fucking try your insane plan to take out a military submarine with nothing but leftover parts hanging around my darling _Prospect_. Go ahead and get Shakes on the pigeon."

"You mean Herschel."

"I don't care what the fuckin' bird's name is. Just make sure Shakes heads back here as silently as fuckin' possible."


[//]: # (### Loading the Gnat)

Hemi got Herschel off with a note to Shakes attached to the bird's leg containing instructions to return to the _Prospect_ submerged and running slowly on battery power. It was going to take a while for Herschel to find Shakes, and then a while longer for Shakes to motor quietly back. Hemi figured he had a couple of hours at least to gather the things he needed.

The magnetic warheads were in the crates he had left in the cargo hold. He selected a half dozen of the ones that were least coated with rust and hauled them to a work table in the engine room. Each weighed about 25 kilograms and consisted of a cylinder containing high explosives that was about 300 millimeters in diameter. Attached to one end of the cylinder was a small-diameter device with the switching mechanism in it, and on top of that was a big plate with a magnet that was strong enough to activate the switching mechanism, but weak enough that it was not likely to actually adhere itself to the target. The magnet was intended to be a trigger, not an attaching component.

The devices were designed to be as simple as possible, with the idea that while a complex device could have more safety features, a simpler device would enable any idiotic naval deckhand to understand how it worked, and thus handle it safely. Details were printed right on the side of the explosives cylinder. 

It was from this block of text that Hemi learned the particular mix of high explosives the cylinder contained was held very stable by a cake of exoskeletons from extinct microscopic sea creatures. It could not be exploded without providing power to the detonation switch and closing the arming circuit. At the same time, the explosive did not seem so finicky that it would not go off in the close presence of another high explosive. A fortunate thing, because Hemi estimated he needed to chain at least two of these devices for detonation if he wanted to blow a hole through the pressure hull of a military submarine.

He used large steel straps to join two of the cylinders together, orienting them so the magnetic trigger plates faced outwards on both ends. He tracked down some batteries and wired them in as the power supplies for the triggers. From a forgotten storage compartment for parts in the engine room he found a pile of old mechanical timed switches that could be wound up and the timer set for when they would close the circuit. He wired these into the arming circuit on each warhead.

He made three more units like this. With two magnetic warhead strapped together, each weighed more than 50 kilograms. Then he plundered the many storage compartments throughout the boat looking for the rest of the parts he needed: some old boat bumpers, heavy line, air hoses and chucks, and his slide rule and clipboard. He wished he had some small clamps, but those were not to be found anywhere. He would have to make do with screw-tightened steel clips. So a screwdriver went on his list of things to find too.

He had most of the parts he needed gathered together when he heard the bump of the _Gnat_ attaching to the bottom of the _Prospect_. By the time Percy's voice came over the PA a few minutes later to let him know Shakes was aboard, Hemi had recruited Gregory to help him move all the parts he had gathered down to the _Prospect's_ battery compartment near the hatch that opened down to the _Gnat_.

As Gregory opened the hatch to see Shakes' greasy-haired visage grinning up at them, Percy's voice came back on the _Prospect's_ PA. "Hemi, Bastian is telling me that he is tracking the sub with the ram closing on us. He thinks they picked up the _Gnat_ and followed Shakes in."

Still down in the _Gnat's_ control seat, Shakes could hear the PA message. "Tell Percy there's no fuckin' way man --- I was ultra fucking slow and quiet on my approach. I could have passed through a sleeping baby's bedroom without fuckin' waking it."

"They were pinging constantly." Hemi replied, leaning over the hatch down to the _Gnat_ to accept the small package of feathers, feet, and beak that Shakes was holding up to him. "They may have simply caught you in motion and followed the only moving object in the water. It cannot be helped now. Here Owen, stow Herschel somewhere safe, and then help me get these parts down to the _Gnat_."

"What's the fuckin' plan?" Shakes asked as he accepted some filthy old boat bumpers down through the hatch and tossed them backward into the cargo space behind him.

"I am coming with you. If the sub with the ram is coming in, we need to get the _Gnat_ off as quickly as possible. I will explain the plan on the way," said Hemi.

Hemi had Shakes swap places with him, and standing down in the _Gnat_ received the heavy explosive units that a straining Gregory and Shakes lowered down to him. After that it was only a matter of minutes to pass down all the odds and ends into the smaller boat.

When it looked like everything was aboard, Shakes climbed down and joined Hemi in the _Gnat_.

"I hope you didn't fuckin' forget anything." Shakes said, looking at the pile of what appeared to be just garbage in the middle of his boat's cargo space.

"If we need anything else, I am sure the copious bounty of the _Gnat's_ hold will provide." Hemi replied.

Shakes grinned. 

"If y'all have everything, I'm going to seal these fuckin' hatches." Gregory called down from the _Prospect_.

Hemi shuffled his big body forward in the cramped space and looked up at Owen. Gregory reached out his still-boyish hand and Hemi lifted one meaty mitt to meet it. Shakes watched them shake.

"Don't fuckin' die down there Captain Shakes." Gregory said, angling his head so his voice reached back to where Shakes was standing.

"If I do, take care of fuckin' Herschel!" Shakes called back as Gregory seated and sealed the _Gnat's_ hatch.

Shakes shimmied forward and slithered into the _Gnat's_ control seat. He unclipped one of the bigger wrenches from his hip and gave the hatch above his head a ringing double-tap to let Gregory know they were about to disconnect. As his hand with the wrench came down, he put out a finger and snapped open the switch that made the circuit to the docking clamps. It was immediately followed by a low thump from the outside of the _Gnat's_ hull.

Hemi was still wedged into the small space next to the control chair. "If you're going to take up that space there big guy, would you mind workin' the fuckin' trim?" Shakes asked. "Give us a little flood."

Shakes had left the _Gnat_ a little over-buoyant while it was attached to the _Prospect_, so even with the docking clamps disengaged the boat's mating collar was still pressed firmly against the _Prospect's_. Hemi twisted open a valve and they could hear water pouring into the _Gnat_. It was only seconds later that the boat dropped a meter or two. Shakes gave the electric motor some throttle and most of the dials in front of the two men suddenly came to life with their little fingers of fate wagging at them.

"_Gnat_, _Gnat_. You boys fuckin' listening?" Captain Percy's voice lit up the ship-to-ship radio.

Hemi closed the trim tank valves and picked up the ship-to-ship mic from where it hung in front of Shakes. "We have you Sylvia."

"I couldn't let you two shitheads just go off and try this dumb-ass fuckin' idea of yours without a proper send-off Hemi."

"Uh, Hemi," Shakes put in, "when are you going to fill me in on the fuckin' details of your little plan here? I'm not so sure I'm likin' the fuckin' vibe I'm gettin' from the rest of yer fuckin' crew."

Percy's voice came back over the ship-to-ship. "How does your inhumanly calculating mind put the odds that this plan will fuckin' actually work?" 

Hemi held up a finger to Shakes. "Frankly, I give it about one chance in five." Hemi said into the mic.

"And what are the chances that you will blow up either the _Gnat_ or the _Prospect_ or both?" Asked Captain Percy.

"At least one of the two boats? I would say one chance in five."

"One in fuckin' four?!" Shouted Shakes.

"But I also think it is very likely that one way or another the plan will bring this pursuit to an end." Hemi continued, still talking to the _Prospect_.

"Counting blowing us up as one way the pursuit could end?" Asked Percy.

"That is right." Hemi paused for a second before continuing. "I would like to also point out that this plan has a better chance of succeeding if you put Cassandra on sonar again."

"No fucking way Hemi. I'll grant you that she has learned fast enough to be perfectly capable of doing the sittin' sonar watch job I hired her for --- I first to see her fuckin' potential you know --- but in this situation where we live or die depending on what the sonar operator hears... nope. That little fucking shit stays in her rack."

"Have you not noticed that with me on the _Gnat_ you are down yet another crew member? You are running a full-sized 100 meter cargo sub with a crew of four --- and that is including Cassandra. During the wars a boat the size of the _Prospect_ would have had a crew of 70."

"I'll put Bastian on sonar. It will be fucking fine."

"You need Bastian to run the trim tanks and Gregory to steer the boat. You need to keep yourself free to think about tactics --- tactics are what will make this plan successful, or not." Hemi paused. "Besides, Cassandra can do this."

There was silence from the radio for a minute. Then: "alright Hemi. It's your fuckin' plan, I fuckin' defer to you. I'll put her back on sonar. If she kills us all, just know my last thought will be that you were fucking wrong."

"I can die with that."

"Seriously. Do your fuckin' best _not_ to die if you fuckin' please. Out."

Hemi hung the mic back on the hook.


[//]: # (### The Gnat runs on the surface; leads the sub with the ram away)

"Bring us up to the surface," said Hemi when Shakes looked at him doubtfully. "The first thing we have to do is try to confuse that sub with the ram into following the _Gnat_, even if for just a short while. We are not ready to use the _Prospect_ for bait... yet."

"The _Prospect_ is going to be the fuckin' bait for the sub with the ram? What kind of fuckin' plan is that?" 

"Bear with me. We need to get the _Gnat_ into position, and I need to prepare some things. Then we will go over the plan."

"OK. To the surface and running on diesel it is." Shakes gave the _Gnat_ a little more throttle while peering through the small viewport in front of him. He turned the steering yoke and drove the _Gnat_ silently out from under the _Prospect_ for a few hundred meters, then pulled back and the little submarine rose until the bow poked softly through the oily ocean surface.

"We're on the fuckin' surface." Shakes turned around in the pilot's seat to talk to Hemi who had moved rearward to sort gear in the hold. "Can you switch the drive from the electric motor to the fuckin' diesel? The levers are just fuckin' back there behind the engine."

Hemi squeezed past the diesel engine that took up most of the interior deck-space in the rear third of the submarine. There he found a series of levers that stuck up from the deck. He had to take a minute to read the hand-written labels, but it rapidly made sense to his mechanically-inclined mind. The system had a clutch so switching between the power sources to the propeller could be made without stopping the boat. Hemi threw out the clutch lever, moved the selection lever over to the diesel, and let the clutch back in.

"OK, looks like it should be on diesel drive now." Hemi called forward.

"Fuckin' sweet. There's a starter button for the diesel just above the levers, can you press and hold that until the diesel fires?"

Hemi pressed the large slick rubber-coated button down with the fat part of his thumb, and the diesel engine in front of him made a few reluctant whines as it turned and the glow plugs warmed up. 

[//]: # (The Gnat has glow plugs to start it, not compressed air --- it was a tractor engine)

But before the engine fired, Shakes interrupted him. "Wait! Hemi, fuckin' wait!" Shakes yelled back from the pilot's seat.

Hemi let his thumb off the starter button and the whine died slowly away.

Shakes joined him a second later. "I almost fuckin' forgot! After the diesel starts I won't be able to hear a fucking thing up there. Here..." Shakes unclipped the largest of the crescent wrenches from his belt and handed it to Hemi. "If you need to get my attention with the engine running, whack that against some metal part of the boat."

Hemi nodded as Shakes grinned at him and slammed his thumb down on the starter.

Hemi knew it would be loud. But he was not prepared for the sheer penetrating amplitude of the voluminous engine that had no muffler to speak of. It rolled and roared its way to life and the pressure of the sound swamped the entire interior of the small craft from bow to stern.

Being direct drive, unlike the _Prospect_, the _Gnat's_ engine also shook the boat a lot more. Also unlike the _Prospect_, the _Gnat's_ diesel changed pitch and volume as the boat gained speed and the engine had to work harder. Shakes pushed the throttle forward and the already all-consuming sound grew, clawing its way into the deepest folds of Hemi's tweed clothing until the bass notes vibrated his clothes against his skin, resonated in the huge void of his chest, and shook every last tiny screw holding the _Gnat_ together.

Hemi squeezed himself into the small space next to the pilot's seat where Shakes was guiding the boat. In that space he could reach the sonar controls, which Shakes had set up close enough to the pilot's seat that normally he would work the sonar himself while driving the boat. With Hemi aboard he was happy to let Hemi keep an eye on the sonar.

Hemi did not even bother with the headset. There was no way they would hear anything on passive sonar above the raucous engine noise of the _Gnat's_ diesel. But he punched the active sonar ping button and it was loud enough to get a response. The sonar sweep laid out a speckled ground plan of contacts in the ten nautical miles or so around the _Gnat_. Hemi waited five minutes and then fired off another ping. Only one dot had changed position, and that was the sub with the ram. It had moved from its intercept course with the _Prospect_ and swung around to follow the engine noise of the _Gnat_.

[//]: # (A ground plan of _Hell_ of course. )

A few minutes later Hemi let go one more ping just to be sure the sub with the ram was still following the _Gnat_, which it was. Then he powered down the sonar unit. Any further pings would run the risk of giving away the position of the _Prospect_ to the sub with the ram after Captain Percy started maneuvering her boat. For the time being, with the _Gnat's_ engine overwhelming everything else in the water, Hemi would have to just guess what the status of the other boats was.

Hemi caught Shake's eye and pointed up to the hatch. Shakes nodded, and squeezed off the other side of the pilot's seat. Hemi passed through the space of the vacated pilot's chair to climb up and open the hatch above. He stepped out into the shallow stream that washed over the deck of the _Gnat_.

The surface was mostly calm with little breeze under a bright gray sky. With the hatch now open, Shakes piloted the boat standing, with his head up out of the sail, keep a fierce eye ahead for large pieces of debris or sunken hulks. Hemi shaded his eyes and scanned the horizon behind them. They had only made a few miles from the _Prospect_, and Hemi could still see its gray sail rolling slowly from side to side, outlined dimly against the gray sky. But it was just one of a half dozen other large inert masses bobbing on the ocean surface within eyesight, not to mention the hundreds of smaller bits slowly churning through the scummy black water and occasionally clacking against each other. 

Hemi sat on the _Gnat's_ low sail, just astern the open hatch and in front of the diesel exhaust that blew away abaft in a long stream of airborne crud. Shakes reached down into the sail and withdrew a pair of binoculars which he handed to Hemi. 

Hemi could see nothing moving under power on the surface besides themselves, which meant the sub with the ram was probably operating submerged. As with everything to do with submarining, this plan of Hemi's would be a series of very long, slow moves interspersed with terrifyingly quick determining actions.

Hemi scanned back and forth across the horizon for 20 minutes or so, and then a small aspect change of the _Prospect's_ sail caught his practiced attention. It had stopped swaying, and was now holding itself bolt upright. Hemi focused his binoculars on it, and a few minutes later it sank silently downwards. The viscous black surface closed over it with a sucking sound that Hemi almost imagined he could hear.


[//]: # (### The Gnat dives; assembling the devices; the plan)

At this, Hemi signaled to Shakes to make way so he could climb back down into the bowels of the _Gnat_. He returned to assembling the devices he had been working on. He made careful calculations with his slide ruler, and noted them on his clipboard. Then he connected an air hose to a valve of the _Gnat's_ compressed air system, and blew air into the old boat bumpers he had brought from the _Prospect_. After each bumper was filled, he put a gauge on it and checked the precise pressure inside the bumper. When he was satisfied with the level of inflation, he sealed the bumper shut with a screw-tightened clip, and then lashed it to one of his paired explosive cylinders.

The resulting device was crude, but Hemi trusted the numbers on his clipboard and the fundamental simplicity of the weapons he had created.

Another hour had passed as he worked, and Hemi intuited that it might be time to check on the sub with the ram. He lifted the big crescent wrench and smacked it against the hull of the _Gnat_ with all his might. Shakes lowered his head and looked around at the clanging sound that managed to creep across to him just above the racket of the diesel engine, and saw Hemi giving him a "kill it" gesture. Shakes gave Hemi a thumbs up and then throttled back. 

The sound of the engine died down enough to give Hemi a tremendous sense of relief. Shakes pointed to the engine kill button on the wall and Hemi thumbed the button. True silence --- silence like Hemi had never quite experienced before in all his years on submarines --- overtook the small boat.

The silence only lasted a second before Shakes' suddenly nasally-sounding voice broke in. "What the fuck're we doin' now?"

"Take us down. As deep as the _Gnat_ can go."

"OK... then switch us back to the fucking electric motor, man. And now maybe with the quiet back on us, you can fuckin' fill me in on your apparently suicidal fuckin' plan."

"Shortly, Captain Shakes. We must check the sonar first, and I am sure you can appreciate the pragmatism of that order to things."

Hemi pulled the levers in reverse order to before to disengage the drive from the diesel and re-engage the electric motor. Unlike the diesel the electric motor did not have to be started. Shakes just pushed the throttle forward and the much softer hum of the electric drive motor increased in pitch along with the slight sense of acceleration.

Hemi stepped forward and powered up the passive sonar unit. He lifted the headset from the welded steel peg from which they hung and put it on. He listened to the quiet ocean around them. He could not hear the _Prospect_ at all --- Percy must be running very slowly. But swinging the mics around he found the sub with the ram easily --- a few nautical miles off to the west of the _Gnat_. Even though the pursuing sub had to be much further away than the _Prospect_, and even though they were running submerged on electric motors, the sub with the ram was running fast enough to be easily tracked. They did not care who knew where they were.

It took Hemi about 15 minutes of listening to get a grasp on the situation. The sub with the ram had given up the pursuit of the _Gnat_, probably not long after Shakes and Hemi had started the engines. Hemi assumed they had quickly realized the _Gnat_ was once again playing a decoy. But the _Gnat's_ run had apparently thrown just enough confusion into the water for the sub with the ram to have lost their bead on the _Prospect_. They had taken up a search pattern again, and Hemi tracked them turning through a multi-mile diameter circle searching for the _Prospect_. They were pinging regularly, so if _Percy_ was moving, there was a good chance they would find the _Prospect_ soon.

Hemi pulled back one earpiece and turned to Shakes. "There is not much time. Give us all the speed the _Gnat_ has got underwater. We have to get between the sub with the ram and the _Prospect._"

"Ya, OK Hemi. But... now you absolutely fuckin' have to tell me what the fuckin' plan is."

"Well..." Hemi lowered the headset so it sat around his thick neck and made a wide gesture towards his devices piled up in the _Gnat's_ rear cargo space. "The plan is pretty simple, really. I intend to suspend some of the magnetic warheads I saved from the last shipment in the water column. With some careful calculations, I hope to set them in such a way that the sub with the ram will move into one and set it off, hopefully disabling the submarine."

"Ah," said Shakes. "So it's just a little fuckin' matter of flushing one of those bad boys out the escape trunk at precisely the right depth and in the path of that big ugly fucking sub, eh?"

"I can control the depth with the amount of air in these old boat bumpers. I have calculated the pressure needed in the bumpers with enough precision, I believe, so that they should float at precisely 25 meters deep. That should take care of the Z axis, but I need you to navigate us across the path of the sub with the ram."

"That may not be so fucking easy."

"I am aware. I will be listening on sonar though. I am confident the _Gnat_ is capable of doing the job."

"Well of course this boat can fuckin' do it! ...I just never thought I'd be using the _Gnat_ to play fuckin' chicken with a full-sized full-speed foul-looking ram-headed fuckin' military sub."


[//]: # (### Getting the boats and the devices into position)

Hemi put the headset earpieces back over his ears and listened closely as he slowly spun the sonar in an arc across the direction of the bow of the _Gnat_. He slowed when the microphones were pointed a little off the starboard side, and then stopped.

"Sylvia is on the move." Hemi said quietly.

"Really? Seems fucking stupid with that sub looking for her."

"That's the 'bait' part of the plan: she will let the sub with the ram find her, and chase her. As soon as she heard us shut down the diesel she ramped the _Prospect_ up to something like ten knots --- to make it look like she is trying to make a run for it."

"They are submerged?"

"Yes. We planned for the _Prospect_ to run at about 30 meters down --- that way they can move fast with less risk of hitting a derelict. But her batteries are very low. I estimate she can only maintain ten knots for perhaps 20 minutes, so we have to move quickly to put this plan into action."

Shakes leaned his hand on the throttle, but it was already pushed all the way to the forward stop. The electric motor whined steadily from behind them, driving the small boat forward with all the force it could muster.

"Come port to 227 degrees," said Hemi, with his hand cupped over the earpieces of the headphone, trying to eek out just that marginal amount more sound dampening that might be what he needed to hear some crucial thing out in the water. Shakes leaned the yoke slightly to the left and the boat heeled over in response.

"Down. 30 meters. The sub with the ram has clearly heard the _Prospect's_ run and matched its depth. They are lined up in pursuit a little less than five miles behind. We need to intercept their course in the next ten minutes or so, if we possibly can." Hemi lifted a stopwatch that hung from the same peg the sonar headset was stowed on and clicked it once to reset it to zero. He counted for a few seconds while listening, and then clicked it a second time to start the stopwatch. He made a note on the clipboard.

"If your plan doesn't fuckin' work, the _Prospect_ is fuckin' done for. Honestly, I'm not even sure why those fuckers haven't already fired a fuckin' torpedo."

"There are still a number of derelicts around. A torpedo is a precious thing. At the moment it is still too likely they would hit one of those garbage hulls rather than their target." Hemi looked down at the stopwatch, ticking away loudly and quickly. "I have to get ready. Do not change speed or course."

"Fucking right."

Hemi left the headset behind on its peg, now relying entirely on the stopwatch and the unvarying speed and course of the _Gnat_ to know where he was in the water. He gingerly moved toward the stern, stepping over and around the detritus Shakes felt was perfectly reasonable to cast about in his only living space. 

He picked up one of the devices, and it was heavy enough that even Hemi struggled a little to lift it. In addition to the sheer weight of the two warheads strapped together, he had to manage the awkward bumpers and lines that managed to tangle themselves repeatedly around the myriad protrusions that all submarines have into their interior spaces.

The escape trunk was located behind the engine and motor, so it took some effort on Hemi's part to pass one of the heavy devices through the narrow space and push it back until it was underneath the thick cylinder of the escape trunk that hung down from above. The escape trunk had a heavy hand-screw sealed hatch on the bottom of the cylinder. Hemi opened the hatch and hefted the device up into the narrow interior space of the escape trunk. He struggled to get it to sit on the narrow ledge that circled the hatch inside. The ledge was intended to be a foothold for the person who wanted to escape while sealing the hatch from the inside. 

It was difficult to get the heavy warhead package to balance on it, but he did manage eventually to arrange it so it no longer tried to tilt back into the empty space over the hatch. Then he piled the excess line on top of the warhead package and stuff the bumpers in. The bumpers were even more of a challenge to position so they would stay up in the escape trunk, but at least they hardly weighed anything and had no chance of exploding if dropped. He finally got the bumpers to stay in the trunk by propping them on the ledge and leaning the two bumpers against each other.

Finally, Hemi reached back up into the escape trunk and wound the mechanical timers that would close the circuit to arm the warheads when the timer reached zero. He set them to a frighteningly-short five minutes --- hardly enough time for the _Gnat_ to drive clear of the amount of explosive the combined warheads packed. But he could not risk the devices being unarmed when the sub with the ram came within range of them. 

Time was compressing down on Hemi. The little mechanical timers buzzed away with their sound reverberating around inside the circular steel walls of the escape trunk. The rickety little devices strove desperately to count out their five minutes with some precision. Hemi gingerly lowered the escape trunk hatch down and spun the sealing wheel closed, which cut off the quick ticking of the timers and left him in silence.

[//]: # (### Releasing the devices; breaching the Gnat)

Hemi looked around the outside of the escape trunk for a control that would flood it. The only promising component was a massive unlabeled lever set into the top of the pressure hull above his head. 

"Shakes, how do you flood the escape trunk?"

"Flood? Hemi this ain't no fucking commercial sub with some kind of specs-mandated flood-and-pump escape trunk for getting a crew of 50 off a boat. The _Gnat_ has a normal crew complement of just one, so the escape trunk is a one-time use only. That big ugly lever above your head releases the escape trunk topside hatch which is rigged a giant fucking spring to open it. There's another lever inside the escape trunk just like it that does the same thing. The hatch opens and the ocean pours in. That's fucking it."

"So it cannot be reset underwater then?"

"Hells the fuck no. Fuck, the only reason I even put in an escape trunk was so I could flush out any problematic cargo if I got into a sticky situation with a fuckin' Authority vessel. That... and I was fuckin' terrified of being stuck on the bottom of the ocean and unable to open the fuckin' sail hatch."

"Alright. It will have to do. Be ready, I will open the escape trunk in another minute or so."

Hemi held the stopwatch up in front of his eyes and the second hand rapidly screwed itself across the face of the watch. In his head Hemi could see their position in the water, see where the _Prospect_ should be off to their port side, and see the sub with the ram --- all black and fiercely toothy in the front in an way that was entirely unnatural for a submarine --- charging towards Shakes' rickety little craft from starboard. The boats all moved relative to each other in his head, driven into position by the second hand on the stopwatch. He put his hand up to the heavy iron lever covered with flecks of rust above his head.

The second hand curled around and came up level. In Hemi's head the boats were all in the exact position. His thick fingers tightened on the lever and then the muscles all the way down his arm to his shoulder tightened --- the lever had been resting and rusting peacefully for years.

But it budged, then gave, then swung back. From above his head came a loud clang as the escape trunk hatch snapped open and back against the deck of the _Gnat_. Hemi could almost feel the intense weight of the water under the pressure of three atmospheres dropping into the escape trunk almost instantaneously. He put his ear against the trunk. Through the cold damp steel he could hear the gentle bumping as his device lifted up and clear of the trunk.

"The device is away Shakes!" Hemi called forward.

"...Are you sure about that? I'd hate to find out it's stuck in there and fuckin' arming itself."

"I am as sure as I can be. Blow the tanks --- the surface is going to be the safest place for us in the next few minutes."

"Fuckin' aye Boss." Shakes reached down and pulled up on the heavy red lever at his feet. The _Gnat's_ compressed air reserves blew past him in the boat's narrow pipes with a whistling hiss. Water burbled heavily out from the boat's ballast tanks into the surrounding ocean. The Gnat started upwards --- slowly for a second --- and then a moment later gaining speed. "Hang the fuck on to something Hemi!"

Hemi could feel his stomach dropping and grabbed one of the freezing pipes that ran along the hull next to him. He gripped the pipe with his hard fists, his knuckles whitening through his cracked skin. The pipe was so cold the moisture of his palms froze and his skin stuck to the metal.

Hemi had ridden submarine ballast blows up hundreds of times, but the tiny _Gnat_ was a different experience from a big cargo sub like the _Prospect_. In the _Prospect_ it was a dramatic but graceful maneuver, with the power and dynamism of a calving glacier. The _Gnat_ was another matter entirely. More like a bird of prey diving on a small sparrow. The whole boat shook with the strain of it, the hull made sounds like it was cracking apart --- and it was by no means clear to Hemi that it was not. When the bow popped through the surface a second later, the boat came down hard and Hemi was forced to rip one hand from the pipe and throw it up to keep his head from being driven up into the escape trunk lever.

On the surface, the bow of the boat, which had taken on a dramatic upward angle from the ballast blow, settled slowly ahead of the two men. The _Gnat_ leveled out and a sense of calm flowed through the craft. As soon as he was sure the maneuver was complete, Hemi moved rapidly past the engine and pushed in next to the sonar unit. He had the headset on and was tracking the sub with the ram in a few seconds.


[//]: # (### The first explosion)

Shakes cut the throttle to the motor and caught Hemi's eye. He pointed to the hatch at the top of the sail with a questioning look, and Hemi nodded. Shakes lifted himself up, unscrewed the hatch and sat up on the sail scanning the flat gray water behind the _Gnat_. With little wind there was almost no noise. There was only a stifling silence, broken by nothing except the soft slap of water against the drifting hull. The sea was mottled in places with black oil that reflected back the gray of the sky, making Shakes feel like they were floating in bath of concrete slurry.

Nothing moved as one minute passed under that silent dome of sky, then another. Shakes shaded his eyes against the brightness of the sky and scanned the water between him and the horizon line, looking for any surface manifestation of the movements going on below.

Another minute passed. And then, much closer than Shakes had anticipated, the heavy thud of an underwater explosion broke through the surface, and a plume of water, driven up and forward by explosive momentum shot upwards and dropped a gray oily rain onto the deck of the _Gnat_. The rain passed up in a rapid squall line from stern to bow, soaking Shakes where he sat on the sail.

"Ha ha! Fuck Hemi! It fuckin' worked!"

"Hold on." Hemi's voice came up darkly from below. "I am tracking the sub on sonar."

Shakes initial feeling of excitement that such a claptrap device actually worked subsided to be replaced by the more rational thought that detonating the device was one thing, actually damaging the sub with the ram was another. He stared into the water next to the _Gnat_ for a moment, and saw a long black shadow --- endlessly long and thin, it seemed to him --- pass under his boat down there in the depths below.

"The device worked, but I am not hearing any sign that they were damaged." From where he was standing below, Hemi's voice did not reveal any sense of disappointment. "They just passed under us, still tracking the _Prospect_." 

"So that's fucking it? Impenetrable fuckin' hull?"

"They hit my explosive with their ram, which is probably a very well-reinforced part of the ship." Hemi hesitated. "We need to figure out how to deliver a charge to a weaker part of the ship."

"Yeah, and while you are pondering that tiny fuckin' challenge, they are closing in for a shot on the _Prospect_."

"Hopefully Captain Percy can manage one close pass by the sub with the ram and give us time to get another device into position. We need to get the _Gnat_ back under water."

"Hang on, don't forget we need to reset the fuckin' escape trunk first."

"How do you pump the water out of the flooded trunk?"

"Pump! Ha. Just open the fuckin' bottom hatch down there, and let it run into the bilge. Then we'll turn on the bilge pumps to toss the water off the boat."

"Elegant." Hemi slid his big body back past the engine again, and a minute later Shakes saw the water in the escape trunk drop away into the bottom of the _Gnat_.

Shakes stepped out of the sail and leaned over the now empty escape trunk where Hemi's round, black-bearded face was looking up at him. "Maybe I should rig some kind of pump for the escape trunk." Shakes said to him. "I actually have to do that emptying maneuver more often than I like. The fucking hatch opens sometimes while diving, just from the fucking stresses on the hull I guess. Fucking pain in my ass."

"You could just fix the latch to make sure it only opens when it is supposed to." Hemi said. "When we are done with this project, I can help you with that."

"You mean if we _live_ through this fuckin' scare-quotes _project_."

------


[//]: # (### In the Prospect)

In the control room of the _Prospect_, Captain Percy heard the detonation of Hemi's device, stripped of all but the lowest frequencies as the sound passed through miles of water and refracted through her boat's hull.

"Cassandra!" Percy shouted down to the sonar compartment. "Tell me what they fuck just happened!"

Cassandra nervously fumbled with the directional control wheel for the sonar mics and flipped switches controlling filters on and off. "There was an explosion..."

Percy sighed. "I fucking know that Cassandra. Did the explosion hit the sub with the ram by any chance? Are those fuckers sinking right now?"

"I... I can't tell. There's nothing but silence out there at the moment."

"Fucking figure it out Cassandra! I'm fuckin' depending on you here."

"The explosion definitely came from the pursuing sub --- I'd say they hit Hemi's device. But..."

A full minute passed.

"But what Cassandra? I need to know what is fucking happening!"

Cassandra sighed. "I can hear them now. The pursuing sub is still after us. It is definitely not sinking. As far as I can tell, it isn't even fucking damaged."

"Fuck me!" Percy spat and lit a cheroot. "It sounded so fuckin' good. I thought we'd at least have taken a bit of wind out of their fuckin' sails." This she said mostly to herself.


[//]: # (### Another torpedo fired at the prospect; hits derelict)

"Captain Percy!" Cassandra was shouting now. "There's a torpedo in the water! They've fired at us!"

"Stay calm Cassandra." Percy's kept her voice very even. "This is very important: has the torpedo acquired us? Is it pinging us? If so, we have to dive _now_. And if we dive, this plan is over."

"I don't know Captain Percy!"

"Figure it out Cassandra. You know what a pinging torpedo sounds like. Listen until you can see what's happening in your head. Then tell me what I need to do."

Cassandra slowly closed the lids over her large eyes. The earphones of the sonar pumped sound into her head and her mind passed out of the _Prospect_ and into the water. She searched around with it, looking to port, then to starboard behind the _Prospect_, passing over the dead zone where the prop wash made her deaf. She honed in on the torpedo --- a high whining electric motor just off their rear port side. She wrapped her head around it, and in her mind she could see the machine --- a long, slick steel tube slipping through the water at a speed that was far faster than anything else she'd ever heard. It was coming directly toward her.

It started pinging. The round ringing echo of it almost hurt her ears.

"OK Captain Percy." She said loudly enough for Percy to hear, but kept her voice calm. "It's pinging."

"That means it's probably armed. Now tell me if it seems like it is tracking the _Prospect_. Bastian, come port 20 degrees."

Bastian spun the rudder control wheel and the boat listed slightly over to the left side as it made its turn.

Cassandra did not hear any corresponding change to the torpedoes direction. "It doesn't seem to be tracking us Percy --- no change to direction."

"OK, it hasn't acquired us... yet. What's the range?"

Cassandra looked at the active sonar rig readout. "1.3 miles."

"That's not very much room to play with Cap," said Bastian, nervously fingering the throttle control.

"No shit Bastian."

Bastian lit a cigarette and blew smoke out from one side of his mouth.

Cassandra let her mind slip out into the water again. The frequency of the torpedo's pings had increased. It seemed to Cassandra like the device was gaining confidence, more sure of its target. But what was the target?

Cassandra scanned back and forth in wider arcs around the _Prospect_ with the sonar. Then, farther off to their port side, she could hear a hole in the water. A mass that bounced back the torpedo's pings at her, and at the same time a void that sucked in her consciousness until her mind passed around and under it, and she could see the shape clearly in her head.

"Captain Percy! The torpedo is tracking a derelict!" She announced confidently.

"Are you sure?"

"Absolutely. It will hit at any..." In her earpieces the explosion suddenly pierced through her mind, and she yanked the headset off, but she was too slow to save her ears from being swamped with a painful and enduring ringing sound.

A second later the detonation rumbled through the hull of the _Prospect_.

Percy smiled. "Nice fucking work Cassandra! I don't think they will risk another torpedo on us in these waters. They wasted two already, and those fucking things are expensive."

"Great," Gregory smirked, "So they'll just go back to trying to fucking ram us."


[//]: # (### Cassandra finds the Gnat, they talk over ship-to-ship about the new plan)

Percy ignored Owen. "Cassandra, the next task is to find the fucking _Gnat_ and figure out what Hemi is doing.

"Right, Captain Percy."

"And don't forget to track those fuckers pursuing us at the same time. What's the range?"

"2.3 nautical miles. And they are increasing speed now."

"They're trying to close on us. You might be right Owen." Percy glanced at the battery gauges. They were moving fast enough at ten knots that she could almost see the batteries draining. Those gauges had passed into the hatched red zone. They only had a matter of 20 minutes or so of battery remaining. Then they would be forced to remain stationary or surface --- either was they would be an easy target for a final ramming.

"Find the _Gnat_ Cassandra! Quickly!"

It was not an easy task. While the _Gnat_ created an earth-shaking amount of noise while running diesel on the surface, its small size and tiny electric motor made it nearly invisible under water. And even though it was relatively quite, the noise from the _Prospect's_ electric motors at this speed also drowned out much chance of hearing a target as small as the _Gnat_. The only way it could be done was by carefully filtering the _Prospect's_ motor noise out, and then somehow landing the sonar mics precisely on the bearing of the _Gnat_. Cassandra flipped filters on and off, and adjusted the fine-control dials carefully. Eventually she managed to limit the noise wash from the _Prospect_ to a degree that gave her some sense she might be able to hear her way around it.

She scanned and scanned, back and forth. All the way around the bow too, but mostly focusing on the direction behind where she had last heard the little boat moving. Her mind was out there, deep in the water behind her, but there was nothing but darkness there. She felt like she was blind to everything except for her sense of the _Prospect's_ position, and the sub with the ram steadily gaining on them.

Then she heard the faintest rhythmic pumping noise, off to the starboard side. It had to be mechanical, and the _Gnat_ was the only other machine in the area. She locked in on it, and tracked it carefully for a minute. "I've got them Captain Percy! 30 meters down, almost directly off our starboard side. About a quarter mile off."

"Excellent. They might hear us on ship-to-ship." Percy pulled down the radio mic and called out into the water for Shakes.

"_Prospect!_ Captain Shakes here. I fucking read you. Nice to hear you didn't go down with that last fucking torp."

"Indeed. Unfortunately Gregory here has a theory that now those fuckers are after us for another ramming. Based on the speed they've put on, I'm inclined to agree with him. So... what's the plan now?"

"Aye, fuck. Well Hemi says he still thinks he can take them down. He just needs to deliver one of his devices to a weaker part of their sub than the ram --- which is what they detonated the last one with."

"And how is he going to do that?"

"Fuck if I know. I'm just steering the boat the way the Boss says. Hang on..." A few seconds of static came across the radio, and then Shakes picked up again. "Hemi says you should just keep running --- make evasive moves if you can. He's going to maneuver us into position to deliver a second device."

"OK Shakes. But keep in mind we're down to maybe 15 minutes on the battery here. As soon as we're out, we're a dead-still target for a boat with an intention to ram."

Another second passed. "Hemi says --- fuckin' get this --- 'he will take your remaining battery into his calculations.'"

"If anyone beside Hemi had said that to me, I would not be able to take it as any kind of fucking reassurance. Don't fucking sink Shakes --- I need Hemi back."

"Don't you fuckers sink either --- I've gotten used to the fuckin' hot meals on your boat! Out." Shakes clicked off.

As Percy hung the mic back up above her head, Bastian reached one long finger out and fruitlessly tapped the battery gauge.

------

[//]: # (### Back in the Gnat to lay the final warhead)

"We have to go deeper Shakes. 50 meters."

"Can't fuckin' do that Hemi. The fuckin' _Gnat_ was built at altitude man! Below 30 and the seams start splitting. 50 is out of the fuckin' question."

"If we lay the mines shallow, the sub with the ram hits them head on. As you could see from the first device, the ram essentially acts as heavy plated armor. We are not going to do any damage if their boat hits the mine with the ram. If we can get the device _under_ their boat though --- if we can get it to detonate right in the middle of their sub --- the upward force of the explosion will blow through the middle and break the sub's back. Snap it in half. And all the watertight compartments in the world will not help them at that point. At least in theory."

"That sounds to me like the _Gnat_ would have to be directly under them, release the mine, and have it go off almost immediately. How are we fucking surviving that Hemi?"

"Not quite. I will set the arming timer. We can leave the mine under their path, and if I get the timer right, the weapon will arm just as the middle of the sub passes over it --- and detonate immediately. We would have a few minutes at least to move the _Gnat_ to safety, probably the surface again."

"You can calculate the timing that precisely?"

"I believe so. It is just a refined use of dead reckoning."

"Never was very fuckin' good at dead reckoning myself."

"All you have to do is drive the boat Captain Shakes."

"...Down beyond a depth I never intended to take it."

Hemi pounded on one of the roughly-welded thwarts. "It is a good boat. I think it is capable of more than you give it credit for."

"I'd have more fucking faith in that statement if it came at a time when you were not trying to convince me to do something incredibly fucking suicidally stupid with the _Gnat_."

Hemi grinned and patted Shakes on the shoulder. He picked up the sonar headset and put one earpiece over his ear. After a second of listening, he gave Shakes a new course. "Come left to 330. That will put us on an intercept with the sub with the ram again." Hemi started his stopwatch.

It was natural that any person piloting the _Gnat_ could not help but look out the small viewport set into the sail at eye level. After aligning the bow of the boat to 330, and pushing the throttle control all the way up, Shakes' eyes moved upward and peered out into the murky water. There was nothing to see, but Shakes could never resist the temptation to try.

"10 minutes Shakes," said Hemi, speaking softly since he was less than a meter from Shakes' head. "We need to start descending now."

"Just curious Hemi, how fuckin' deep do you think it is here?"

"More than 1000 meters. All we are asking the _Gnat_ to do is swim a bit deeper in the very top layer of all that water. No big deal."

Shakes patted the rusting cold steel of the hull closest to his head. "Boat, You're the only thing that can keep us from being sucked into that hole under us. It wants us, I can feel it --- but you're a good little boat, even Hemi says so. You're just the tool to keep us out of that fucking hole." With this clandestine blessing, he pushed the yoke forward and the _Gnat's_ little dive planes responded by angling downward.

They gained depth quickly, and almost immediately the hull of the _Gnat_ began to groan with the stress of it.

"40 meters."

"The boat is doing great Shakes."

Crackling sounds snapped and echoed from somewhere deep in the forward compartment.

"_Captain_ Shakes. And tell the boat, not me man," said Shakes. His hands were sweating. He put a cigarette to his lips, but forgot to light it.

Hemi stared at his ticking watch.

"45 meters."

"OK, start leveling out," said Hemi, "I think you can stay above 50. I have to go prep and load the mine." Hemi listened for one second more to the sonar, checked his stopwatch, and sidled back to load the second device into the escape trunk. 

The _Gnat_ clearly did not like being this deep, it groaned and cracked and gave every impression of being on the verge of imploding. Hemi reassured himself that he had been in lots of boats that were just 'noisy' when they went deep --- though apparently perfectly sound. Some boats just liked to vocally let their operators know about the stress they were suffering, like whiny children. On the other hand, those were professionally-built boats designed by engineers. Those boats just happened to have a few idiosyncrasies. Hemi could not shake off the knowledge that this boat was built by... Shakes. It was _all_ Idiosyncrasy.

It was only a minute later before both Hemi and Shakes knew it was not just the _Gnat_ being vocal. There was water in the bilge and it was rising. They could hear water sloshing around. Somewhere in the _Gnat_ the seams were leaking.

"Better hurry Hemi. I'm not sure how much longer we can stay this deep."

Hemi looked at the stopwatch. "3 minutes. Just hold the boat right at the level and speed you have --- do not let anything change."

Hemi had stuffed the explosive cylinders, bumpers, and lines of the second device up into the still-wet escape trunk. He quickly scribbled calculations on his pad, made adjustments to his slide-rule, looked at the stopwatch, and came to a solution. He reached up and set the timers on the explosive cylinders. "I hope that is correct." He said to himself, and sealed the device into the escape trunk.

"30 seconds!" Hemi called forward. He put his hand on the lever. The hand of the stopwatch ticked around, climbing upwards. It hit the zero mark. Hemi hefted the lever that released the escape trunk hatch. It slid easily back this time. 

It took a second for Hemi to realize that was because the hatch above him did not open.

"That hatch is not open!" Hemi yelled forward, real panic slipping into the baritone of his voice.

"Fuck! The pressure Hemi! The whole hull is compressed, the hatch must be wedged in its fucking seat!"

Hemi smacked a heavy fist against the hull above him. 

Shakes could hear the pounding in the pilot's seat. "Hemi. You have to get that open. If the weapon arms in the trunk, we're fucking done."

"I am aware of that!" Hemi pressed his lips together, concentrating on revising his estimates of where the boats were in relation to each other, and at the same time trying to figure out a way to release the hatch. "Come shallow by a few meters," Hemi shouted forward, "...that might be all we need." A second went by and Hemi knew they were getting out of position. "You also need to come left to 222 degrees, Hard! Now!"

The boat leaned over dramatically as Shakes turned the yoke left all the way to its stop. At the same time the bow rose slowly in response to his gentle backwards pull on the yoke.

Hemi pounded and pounded against the hull. He slid the release lever in and out uselessly. "No throttle! We will be too close!"

Shakes pulled the throttle back and the boat drifted. Hemi picked up the crescent wrench and smacked the hull repeatedly until he left dents. Sweat beaded at his temples and his face went red with a deep anger rarely seen on his calm features. He let out a yell that scared Shakes to his core. 

Hemi gave one final smack against the release lever with the wrench.

He heard a pop, and water fall into the escape trunk. Hemi quickly leaned over and slapped his ear against the wet steel of the escape trunk. He could hear the mine lifting away out of it. "It opened! Full throttle! Any direction! Get us away from here!"


[//]: # (### The sub with the ram is exploded; the Gnat is sinking)

The electric motor wound up behind Hemi and the sudden acceleration almost rolled Hemi off his feet.

Shakes lowered his head and tried to see up through the tiny viewport. Above the _Gnat_ the water was lighter. He saw a dark shadow pass through the light. 

"Blow the tanks!" Hemi yelled from the rear of the sub.

Shakes pulled the lever, and the air blew through the boat. But the depth gauge did not move. Shakes tapped the gauge. He pushed the lever down, and pulled it up again, hard. Shakes believed deeply that with mechanical things you sometimes just had to get physical.

Nothing happened.

No fucking go Hemi." Shakes said with some kind of resolve reflecting in his voice. "We must have cracked the ballast tanks. The blow isn't fuckin' doin' anything."

At that moment the mine detonated, far to close to the _Gnat_ for safety. The little boat shook to its timbers, and rolled over on its side as the shock wave grabbed the _Gnat's_ small sail. The sound was so loud that it rang Shakes' and Hemi's ears. Whatever small cracks that had opened in the seams before now split wide and freezing black water poured in.

The power blinked and then went out. Hemi felt his way forward in the blackness, climbing over the engine. He found Shakes by feel. Shakes was laying against the sonar equipment on the side wall that was now the floor, in half a meter of water that was rising quickly.

"Emergency power. Does the boat have emergency power?" Hemi asked loudly.

"No. Kinda like I said before. We're fucking done."

The _Gnat_ was sinking. 

But not so fast that it did not right itself first. The sucking hole under them pulled harder on the lead weights at the bottom of the boat than the rest of it. Slowly the keel was drawn and the sail rolled back up to where it was supposed to be. 

Shakes was almost ecstatic. He started laughing. "Hemi! This is fucking it. But at least the _Gnat_ is going down upright! With some fucking dignity!" He found his lighter and tried to light the cigarette that was somehow still hanging unlit from his lips. The cigarette was soaked and refused to light, but the glow of the flame from the lighter showed them how dire their situation was.

"Give me that." Hemi took the lighter from Shakes and snapped it aflame. He used it to look over the _Gnat's_ controls, waving the flame slowly in front of each terrifying dial and gauge. For good measure he pulled the emergency blow lever again. He opened all the tank trim valves. None of those things required electricity to function --- they were purely mechanical devices on all submarines as a safety precaution for a situation just like this. If there was no power, the sub should still be able to make it to the surface. 

But not if the ballast tanks had split and let the reserve air out. The bubble they need to ride up had made its own way to the surface, leaving uselessly without them.

The water Shakes sat in was rising quickly. Water was pissing in through cracks in the viewport. Hemi looked at the depth gauge --- 100 meters. He let the lighter go out. His whole life he had been able to make these machines --- all machines --- do what he wanted them to. But this particular one was failing him now. Shakes' resignation seemed to be all that was left.

In the darkness he listened the water streaming into the submarine. It sounded like babbling brooks he had known long ago in his youth, on land. With no visual sensory input in the darkness, his mind instead saw the bright sunny brooks that brought fresh water down to the sea on the island he had grown up on. All his years on rusting and leaking submarines, and running water --- a sound of death on submarines --- still remained firstly the sound of life and his youth.


[//]: # (### Rescued by the Prospect, lifted from underneath)

A thick clang rang out in the darkness. Hemi had expected something like this. The pressure hull would be collapsing in on itself. The steel snapping together like the jaws of some beast. He braced himself for the rush of water that should follow it.

Instead the _Gnat_ settled flat, and the descending sensation suddenly jolted to a stop. Hemi lit the lighter and Shakes was staring at him with a puzzled look on his face. Hemi looked at the depth gauge: it was rising.

"What the fuck?" Shakes asked.

"...The _Prospect_. They must have got under us."

"And now they're fuckin' raising us to the surface? Like some fucking new born whale? Fuck me! Fucking fuck me!"

"I certainly find myself overcome with awe." Hemi replied.

Shakes stood up and took the lighter back from Hemi. He lit it and with a renewed hope for life, he crawled forward. He pushed Herschel's empty and guano-covered roost aside and pulled open a fuse box panel that lay behind it. He rummaged through a pile of old and corroded fuses that lay at the bottom of the fuse box to find one that looked like it was still at least partially conductive. He ran his finger down the rows of blown fuses till he found the one he wanted and yanked it out. The hopefully-working replacement went into the fuse box in its place.

He knew it did work because the radio panel lit up and the rapidly dwindling space of air in the sub was filled with the sound of radio static. "Try the ship-to-ship!"

Hemi picked up the mic from the front of the glowing box, and squeezed the transmitter. The transmit power needle snapped to the right, just as it should. "_Prospect_, this is Hemi, aboard the _Gnat_, do you copy."

"Fuckin'-A Hemi!" Percy's voice came back through the box. "We were worried that you were already fucking flattened, and we'd just be bringing up your corpses in a squashed metal coffin! Fuck it's good to hear you. Shakes there?"

"Captain Shakes is here, though wet. How did you find us?"

"Fuckin' Cassandra of course! She managed to pick Shake's shitty little sinking craft out from all the noise of the sub with the ram going down, and then she navigated us down with fucking dead-on precision until we were under you. Just in the fucking nick too! Our batteries flat-lined just after we picked you up. We're rising on a gentle ballast blow right now."

"The pursuing sub?"

"Those fuckers are on their way down the hole Hemi, dragged by their black fuck ram first, I hope. Cassandra said she heard the boat split, and the bulkheads failing, and then the two biggest pieces went down."

There was now light coming through the viewport around the streams of water coming from the cracks. Shakes stuck his head between the lines of water and could just see the shadow of the _Prospect's_ sail out there in the gloom.


# Epilogue


[//]: # (### Fishing and grilling)

The next morning they managed to motor out of the garbage gyre to find a patch of clear sea stretching around them in an enormous circle out to the horizon. By the time the sun achieved a mid-morning altitude that sent the shadow of the _Prospect's_ sail charging out over the water at an angle from the boat, the sea had turned a bright shade of slate-blue. A long slow deep-ocean swell rose and fell all around, giving the impression of passing through a landscape of low hills, though in a queasy way that the traveler feels like they might be standing still and the landscape is moving around them, rather than the other way around.

Even though it was bright daylight, they could not submerge for the _Gnat_ lay on the deck of the _Prospect_, angled to one side by the rounded bottom and the weight of the water still in the bilge. Gregory and Bastian had secured it to the deck with heavy rusted chains and thick grimy straps of webbed cotton, winched tight as piano wires. And indeed, when the wind blew through the straps and chains they hummed with droning tones cut up by the quick staccato of the straps twisting. On top of the drone from the straps came a number of high whistles as the wind found its way through the numerous holes in the split hull of the _Gnat_.

All those whistling splits in the _Gnat's_ hull were the reason they could not submerge. The _Gnat_ was far too damaged from its brief dip below its crush depth for them to repair it at sea. And so it rode on top of the _Prospect_ until they could put in somewhere where repairs could be attempted.

Shakes spent quite a while on the _Prospect's_ deck that morning, going over the damage to his boat. It was beginning to look like the _Gnat_ might end up being more weld than plate --- if it even could be repaired. Even now, as the _Prospect_ rolled on a larger swell, water from the bilge would come streaming out of the _Gnat_ in long greasy lines where the hull was split. It was enough to bring tears to Shake's eyes.

Hemi was far less upset about the damage to the _Gnat_, and instead found himself unusually jubilant. He had been through close calls before, but never before had he given up and been ready to die. He was glad to be out of the _Gnat_. And he was glad to be outside on the deck of the _Prospect_. Since they couldn't submerge without doing further damage to the _Gnat_, and they were going to be running on the surface through all the lovely warm daylight hours, he decided some grilling was in order. He opened up the hatch to the cargo hold, and winched up the soot-covered black grill that had been made by cutting a steel drum in half and then welding legs on and installing hinges to make the top a lid.

From the cargo hold he also hauled up an rusting platform made of welded deck grating and cut tubes. Gregory bolted this platform to the deck next to the sail. It allowed crew to get out past the curve of the _Prospect's_ hull and stand out over the water. From it hung a swim ladder that dipped down into the water below.

Hemi lashed the grill to the deck of the _Prospect_ and spent the first hours of the morning burning down some very old and damp wood he found stashed in the cargo hold. Fortunately the breeze kept the fire hot enough that the dampness was quickly driven from the wood, and in a not-unreasonable amount of time Hemi had the grill bottom glowing with coals.

While Hemi was getting the grill hot, Captain Percy stopped the _Prospect_. As they drifted, Owen, Cassandra, and Bastian stood on the platform and ran out some long poles to drop lines into the sea. They baited the lines with sardines from a can they split open. It was not long before they had a violent mahi-mahi tearing at one of the lines, which Gregory and Cassandra together managed to haul in close enough for  Hemi to heft the huge fish onto the deck from below and club it senseless with a borrowed wrench from Shakes.

Hemi cleaned the fish, leaving a sparkling trail of sticky scales across the deck of the _Prospect_, and threw the head and tail and various viscera back over the side. Big steaks of the meat went onto the grill and Hemi spread a rub of salt, lime juice, and red pepper flakes across it. The flesh browned and burned a little at the edges, and Hemi took the steaks off smoking and dropped them into bowls of rice that Gregory brought up from the galley.

The crew sat on the deck poking at their late breakfast with old bent forks and watched the water rise and fall around them. Herschel waddled around among them, pecking dropped bits of rice from the steel grating. Drifting with the diesel engine shut down left the surface of the ocean nearly silent, and no crew member felt like they needed to intrude upon that silence. For once neither the malevolent violence of nature, nor the chaotic violence of man was trying to do them in, and that made the food taste so much better, and the silence so much quieter.

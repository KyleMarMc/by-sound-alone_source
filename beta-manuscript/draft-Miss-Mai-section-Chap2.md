[in Miss Mai's office]

"Nice to meet you Captain Percy. My friend Turnaround Bob said you were eminently trustworthy and reliable. and also run a big enough boat for the particular job I need done."

"Yeah, Bob tracked me down on the mainland and suggested I head out here and look for you. He hinted the work might be... profitable."

...

"Let me ask you about another thing: Do you know anything about some Authority sub with a big ugly ram mounted on the front of it? Motherfucker just about split the _Prospect_ in half on the way here. It's the reason we came limping in, and now need major repair work done."

At the mention of the ram Miss Mai's eyebrows went up with a look of concern. "A ram on a submarine you say?"

Percy nodded.

"The only time I've heard of such a thing -- at least within this century -- is on a boat called the _Grackle_, An Authority enforcer out of the Northern Points."

"What would it be doing a thousand miles from its home waters?"

"That I do not know the answer to. Except, I'll tell you this Captain Percy. I hear rumors of new governing structures. Things being tried that might eventually drastically weaken the local fiefdoms and establish new flows of global order. One such thing is suggestions I've heard recently that certain Authorities are now granting privateers warrants that promise a bounty on captured or sunk merchant shipping operating under the aegis of certain other Authorities -- regardless of where that shipping is."

"That seems likely to start a few wars."

"It would. Except the rumors are that some of the most powerful Authorities are mobilizing these privateers against much weaker Authorities -- it's possible that rather than a war, what we may end up with is a new global order."

"And you're saying the sub with the ram, this _Grackle_, is one of these privateers?"

"It is one possibility that would explain where and why you encountered it."

"But why the _Prospect_?"

"That's what concerns me the most. Turnaround Bob works quickly and means well, but his information networks leak worse than that docking bay down there. There's a chance that the job you are about to take on is already marked by some Authority as a valid concern for privateers. You may already be a target."

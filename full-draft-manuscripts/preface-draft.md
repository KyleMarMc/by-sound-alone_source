# Preface

## First draft notes
* Perhaps begin with a thing about petcocks:
	* people familiar with old motorcycles know it well
	* super simple mechanical device premised on the idea that the surest way to know you are running out of gas is to actually run out of gas
	* any idiot who could ride a motorcycle could understand how it worked
	* but beyond that, there was a sheer mechanical pleasure that came with swinging around the petcock --- that little bit of mechanical control --- and having the engine roar back to life.
* _There was a generation that lived through a time up to, through, and a little beyond the great world wars. Like us, technology changed their world, and they lived every day of their lives with complex new industrial technologies. But the technology of that time was rooted in _mechanical_ things. Because of that, it was different from the technology of our time. In their time, anyone who wanted to understand how a piece of amazing new technology worked could simply take it apart. It had an intuitive --- though not necessarily simple --- structure. Because of its mechanical underpinnings, even those who did not fundamentally understand how technology worked, could depend on it to behave rationally and intuitively when they used it. Unlike our technology were even experts are often shocked by how it behaves._
* _This old mechanical technology also came with an aesthetic. The mechanical nature of it made the stuff dirty, greasy, and grimy. It was powered by air-fouling burning of things, and kept lubricated by chemical greases and cleaned with penetrating solvents. This aesthetic permeated our culture. The rich found ways to constantly clean it. The poor and the technology maintainers simply lived in and among it. Punks in the grime --- mechpunks or grimepunks, though they never would have referred to themselves that way._
* _The stories of the great wars were often compelling because the could be placed atop a clear moral ground. But I believe many of those stories were also compelling because they could be placed on top of amazing, but intuitively understood technology._ 
* _The story told here, lives in that world. It's confined to technology that is non-magical and through that technology I hope an amazing story emerges that anyone who is interested enough to take the time to understand, can FEEL how the machines behave, what they can and can't do, and ride along with those who try to live in and among them._
* _We live in a world today where technology is on the verge of magic. Only an elite few understand any given technology. It wasn't always like this. At one time technology was a rising force in our culture, but it was knowable. Any person of average intelligence who wanted to understand how things worked could figure it out. That isn't the world we live in today, and there is no way we could return to that world. However, it is possible to imagine a world where technology remained knowable. Such a world could be a setting for telling amazing stories. This is such a story._
* _Here in the 21st Century we live with technology that is almost magical in its complexity. But there was a time, not so long ago, when technology was ascendent but was also something that anyone could understand. It was complex but it's roots were electro-mechanical. Even the most complicated machine could be taken apart and comprehended through diligent common sense. We no longer live in that world, but there's no reason we couldn't have. This is a story from that other technological path we could have taken, but didn't._
* _This book is dedicated to those brave women and men who plied their trade under the waves of a world that, through historical happenstance and the hubris of our own technological and political classes, never existed._
* _The world is what we make it quote from end of Adam Curtis_
